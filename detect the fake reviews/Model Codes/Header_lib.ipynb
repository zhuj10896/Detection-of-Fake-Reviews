      "paid $695/night for the room but to use the hotels wifi will cost you $12.95/day! bottled water will cost you $6/bottle. cheap costco style minibar. tiny bathtub. poorly laid out rooms with lots of unusable space. poor value for the money. not on the level of a five star hotel accomodation. tried to stay at the neighboring st. regis but of course, they were sold out for the dates i needed. i can honestly say that a comfort inn is a better value and they have free wifi!we have visited the spa at moatl a few times, but this time we had a chance to stay over and were looking forward to it. we have stayed mo las vegas and are very familiar with mo standards. this hotel was not up to those standards with the exception of the staff. from the moment you are greeted by the valet, the mo experience starts. this hotel has that right. valet, bellman, and front desk were fabulous. they were great. the first problem occurred at check -in when they informed us that nothing in the ladies spa worked. had we known this ahead of time, we might have canceled our reservation! next we headed to our room which was lovely except it hadn‚äôt been vacuumed because there were pistachio shells all over the floor by the desk upon arrival; therefore, it hadn‚äôt been cleaned. the hot water was very slow in warming up about 10 minutes. after this, we went to the pool area which takes you thru the spa and then to the pool. no surprise the elevator to the pool was broken. we had to go through the part of the building that is not normally seen by the public; therefore, it had rubbish in the stairwell. the pool area was nice; however, the used towels were overflowing in the bin and there weren‚äôt any clean towels. the pool was nice. the breakfast the next day was ok. at this point, i‚äôm so very dissatisfied with the moatl that i question whether mo ever inspects this property. the manager‚äôs response was i‚äôll talk to my staff. our bill for one night was $750.00. for that kind of money, there should have been no problems.we booked the suite got upgraded to the presidential suite no charge insane, the room was phenomenal had to call family to show it off. the service was spectacular everything was set up before we got there. the views from the bathroom incredible. this is one of the best hotel room in the world ..you would be a fool to stay anywhere else plus usher lives in the penthouse serious. and they have a private driver that drives you within two miles in a telsa. like it nowthis location is mismanaged and offers a sub-par, frustrating experience.i reserved a room at the mandarin oriental because i wanted to offer my wife a special five-star experience to celebrate our anniversary. unfortunately, our evening was interrupted several times by staff and things in our room breaking. we left the hotel after our stay frustrated by our experience and the response of the staff.more details:(1) after checking in around 6 pm, we headed upstairs to our room and found that the door was open and housekeeping was in our room. we entered and the sweet lady spent a few minutes finishing up and then assured us that everything was good and ready for our stay. (2) later when my wife got into the shower, she found that the shampoo and soap was open and used by the previous guest.(3) after returning from dinner, our keys would not unlock our door (this was the first time in the evening that we had to use our keys because initially housekeeping was in our room and the door was open). we went back down to the lobby and the staff made us new keys. we went back up and they still didn‚äôt unlock the door. we went back down to the lobby and they sent us back up with a staff member who was able to open the door after trying a number of keys. once inside, the staff member assured us that a technician would be coming by to resolve the problem with the door. about twenty minutes later the technician arrived, looked at the door and said that he had to get some other tools and would be back. twenty minutes later, he returned (during this time it was difficult for my wife and me to start our evening together because we were never certain if someone would be knocking on our door). when the technician returned, he took the door lock apart and replaced a few pieces. when he had replaced the parts the door still did not work. he went down to the lobby and returned with yet another key which finally unlocked the door.(4) the woman at the desk when we arrived was very kind and said that she would send us up something special for our anniversary. this was very kind and unnecessary. however, nothing ever arrived and so all evening we were never sure if we would be interrupted by the delivery of the items which really kept my wife from feeling like she could fully relax and enjoy her stay.because i know how much the mandarin oriental prizes its service and reputation, the most frustrating thing about our stay occurred the next morning when i brought a few of these things to the attention of the floor manager on duty. he was very short with me, barely apologetic, and cut me off several times. all he could tell me was that he appreciated the feedback, would look to improve things in the future and bid me good day.i have been speaking with the mandarin oriental management over email for over three weeks and they have as yet been unwilling to make this situation right.when i booked in for 6 nights, i received 2 free nights as part of the stay 2 get the 3rd free. on booking the website showed me my average rate per night across 6 nights which when the 2 free nights were taken into account across the 6 nights this was within my companies expense cap. i called the hotel to validate and they were friendly and confirmed the two free nights had been taken into account and thus the rate was so low.when i checked out however it all changed. my folio didn't reflect the same average rate and it was the nights costs without the free nights and thus the 4 nights were only reflected and were much more expensive per night as a resulti asked the front desk to provide a folio that aligned to when i booked as that averaged per night rate is what i had approved by my company and he said he couldn't but i should email finance and they would.i emailed finance and edith promptly replied saying they couldn't. i reminded them that spg and hilton (where i am platinum and diamond status respectively) will average out the nights and do it for me all the time and i was appalled at there lack of flexibility as the folio will still be the same amount and i have paid it so no harm done.edith then emailed me one back but for 5 nights and not 6 and i have sent about 5 emails back to her since asking for it to be corrected and they just wont reply to me.i am a spg platinum and hilton diamond thus deal with hotels allot (i travel somewhere pretty much every alternate week) and i am appalled at how i am being treated by a hotel which claims to be better.the hotel was pleasant, after sales service is not.as a result i cant expense this trip as it breaks my per night cap - disgusted by this hotel and will never stay there againthis hotel was very luxurious...staff was super friendly and very attentive...room was super comfortable and had everything in it for a comfortable stay...hotel restaurant was also top of the line...i really enjoyed my stay here...not to mention the good location of the hotelhad the chance to stop by the kitchen, as my job is to check the products to keep the place under sanitary conditions, but there is nothing chemicals really can do if the chefs don't clean the space where they prepare our food, it was great to be a guest, but i'm skipping the cafe and room service in this place forever.room was very hot and took them forever to move us to another room. the cafe was very slow. we will never stay there again . too high and we are back to the westin. hope they can work out all their problemshad a suite with balcony. the balcony was the most depressing thing i have ever seen. no light outside, dinky table and chair, all dark gray cement no adornment at all. it was like a bad office building. just not at all what i was expecting from a mandarin. the room was oddly shaped, with strange set up and wasted space and no where to put room service tray- expensive but did not feel expensive. room service was very professional and fast, the valets are excellent, room was quiet and bed was perfect.walking in: the tea room (lobby?) is tacky and strange, i do not get it. did we miss the lobby? really. meet u in the lobby? nope. i didnt even realize the front desk was the front desk because its more like two podiums in the hallway in front of the elevator. spa: when i figured out where to go, i got a massage and was told the hot water was out in the whole hotel. i couldn't stop laughing throughout my massage, so did therapist. what were all those fancy women getting mud wraps going to do??? i usually try to stay on point in reviews, but i just don't know what to stay about this strange experience. i'm all over the place on this one. missing: welcome envelope from manager, or glass of wine, champagne, a fricking choc strawberry, anything, anything, anything. sigh. where was the manager? the only welcome is from the valet.there is the obligatory maserati parked outside this hotel, but i swear its rented or the awesome valet pushed it there.the hotel is not family friendly. our teenaged children were not allowed in the hot tub areas without much back and forth with management, and even then, it was with very limited hours. since the hot tubs are located in the locker rooms, we were told that the hotel was trying to protect our teens from possibly seeing naked adults. really???we needed one pill of motrin, to get rid of the head ache caused by laughing endlessly at the 'protection' against nudity, and we were charged $2.50 for it.we have stayed at various nice properties, but have never had these problems. a substandard hotel at a high price.the front desk service was average . nothing spectacular. the room service was better however we had ordered champagne for our arrival and when we got there the champagne wasn't in the room after a few hours we finally had to call the room service to complain.i also was annoyed with the front desk when i called withe some questions and after a few they hang up on me. so rude!!!!also as we were leaving one of the wallet employees was to busy watching my husband tip his colleague instead of him that he completely ignored my question and almost hit me with the door.i couldn't believe it.most certainly we won't be staying there againwas not a great experience for us at this hotel. it was an expensive hotel to stay at & we don't mind paying the price when the service is great & you get what you're paying the high price for. our package included breakfast to which you could eat in the dining room or get room service. after 20 hours in transit from australia, we decided that breakfast in the room was a great option for us, so we called the front desk to ask what we could order & she wasn't sure so she connected me through to room service. i asked the same question & she told me that we could order anything on the menu to the value of $40 each. i then repeated to her $40 each to which she replied yes. upon that we ordered juice, coffee, berries, oatmeal & a hot breakfast. it totalled the $80 on the 1st & 2nd days & then $68 on the 3rd day. upon checkout we had excessive charges for breakfast. i told them it was included & she said yes that's correct, but these are the charges that you exceeded over the amount of an american breakfast. she was not interested in anything that i had to say & when i challenged this & what room service had told us, her reply was that she would let them know that it is not $40 per person so it doesn't happen to anyone else. i was not happy with this so she said that she would take those charges off to which i thanked her as this is what i had been told initially & she printed out the bill & put it in an envelope & said the charges had been removed & it was the final bill. i trusted that she had done this & left the hotel only to open it up later to see that she had not done this at all. she had taken a very small amount off & that was it! very sneaky & the bell boy that was assisting us with our luggage overheard what was going on & knew that it wasn't right & gave us a contact name to write to & advise what had happened.also there is no tea or coffee in the rooms, so we ordered 1 cup of tea & 1 cup of coffee one night before bed & when it was delivered to our room the docket had $49 on it. my husband refused to sign the docket at this cost, so they took the docket back & readjusted it to $19. ridiculous price for 2 hot beverages, one being 1 tea bag & a pot of hot water.the second day my husband had to go to the convention centre for a trade show & went to the front of the hotel & asked a bell boy for a cab. he had only been waiting a couple of minutes when the bell boy said to him that he could get him a car to take him as it was also parked there. when he asked how much a taxi would be in comparison to a car, he said it would be the same being $50 & that was a fair price. so upon trusting this he took a car, although when he got a cab home it was $20.80, so it clearly was not a fair price & he felt quite ripped off. when i mentioned this to the front desk & that he felt a little ripped off, the response about the $30 difference was it depended on what cab company as they're all different prices. i said 'really, a $30 difference, i don't think so!' when you are an international traveler you trust that by staying in hotels that are reputable brands, that there would not be issues like we had. we travel a lot internationally & have stayed in several manderin oriental hotels worldwide & have never experienced such bad service from front of house staff. there were no issues with our room it was just lovely, but the whole stay left a bad taste & when we are back in atlanta we will definitely think twice about staying there againi really want to like this hotel and have stayed there many times. like all knockoffs it looks nice from the outside, but lacks functionality and quality of the genuine article. the rooms are great. the beds comfortable, the ac is quiet, the bathrooms clean, and there are enough outlets, but the internet has issues. the spa is also nice, but is not really opulent. there is not really a restaurant the the bar is small and often almost empty. room service quality is average for a 4 start hotel and far below average for a 5 star. the front desk staff are not great especially if something goes wrong. dealing with the finance department can take weeks so make sure you check your bill before you leave and get a copy.i have stayed in hotels all over the world and the mandarin oriental atlanta rates as among the best. beautiful setting, attentive staff, wonderful food, and just an overall charming southern experience. i highly recommend the mandarin oriental atlanta.we arrived at about noon. no room ready, but we understand check in is at 3pm. at 3:30 there was still no word and we went back to get a room. spa mistook my appointment for a time when i would be already home. i had heard this was an old mansion, but turned out to be a large building. did not see any of the southern charm advertised. the nicest people were the greeters at the front entrance. they were always lovely and accommodatingamazing hotel with a caring staff, lovely rooms, great food, and a relaxing spa. the place is intimate and attracts an upscale crowd. excellent choice! try it once and you will never stay at another buckhead hotel again.i arranged to have a room block of 20+ rooms at the mandarin oriental this past week. every detail was accounted for, and they treated my like royalty. if you are staying in buckhead, this is where you need to be. close to marta, the malls, and lots of shopping.overall great stay, beautiful rooms and extremely comfortable bed. the tv in the bathroom was my favorite. disappointed in some of the staff. the ladies at the spa did not give me and my boyfriend a tour of the facility and it is a bit confusing as it is gender separated. the ladies yelled at my boyfriend because he was getting close to the ladies quarters but we had no way of knowing this. we were very embarrassed to have been yelled at. very uncharachteristc of a hotel of this caliberi was so excited to stay here, as the mo in dc is probably the nicest hotel i have ever stayed in. it was fine, but not great.first, the positives. the valets were just excellent. the staff in the restaurant and spa was also excellent. chatty, attentive, and very polite. we enjoyed our time in these areas very much. the hotel was very clean.unfortunately, we were not thrilled with the front desk staff for several reasons. we came for a girl's weekend on the drive and stay promo. when we checked in, we asked for the available upgrade. the woman who checked us in told me quickly and abruptly that there were none available...without looking. she indicated that the only room available was the presidential suite and laughed that there was no chance\" for that. so rude! trust me, a room that big would have been too much, but i was appalled at the tone and chuckle. we did ask for a nice view which she assured me we had. of course, crappy view. honestly, we could not be bothered with dealing with them anymore. our room was nice, but the furnishings were scratched with missing pieces. our maid did a wonderful job with what she had to work with. we asked the front desk to print our bill for review and it took 3 attempts. there were 4 staff members just standing around. we just found the front desk staff to be unhelpful and not at a level that i expect at the mo.finally, we were supposed to get breakfast as part of the package, but were nickeled and dimed to the degree that we always owed a good bit for the meal.it was a nice hotel, but i will try something different next time. i would not expect to get any of the perks associated with a package there again.\"i really enjoyed my stay here, the rooms are very nice and clean. the staff was over the top . very friendly i will return and spread the word to everyone that's coming near this way . i really loved this hotel ...............................we absolutely loved everything about this place !!!!!! very friendly staff .. rooms were clean ... and the beds were awesome !!!!!! i really enjoyed my stay and will be back soon. thanks for the great customer service!!!!!!!!!we had reservation at the ritz carlton but after seeing reviews on tripadvisor i changed our reservation for both the hotel and spa. i was very disappointed the spa greeter was very rude to me, the spa was not at the standard i was hoping for. then got back to room to order a cheeses and fruit trey and the lady who took my oder had no clue, so i order a meat and cheese trey only to have the fruit and cheese trey delivered from the manager two minutes later. that was nice and i was very appreciative. then later that day the maid walked in on us while we were getting ready to out for dinner. needless to say we will not be back. we left there and went to the ritz carlton at reynolds plantation in greensboro, ga and it was awesomeam writing midway through our stay here. we stay in luxury hotels all over the world including the mandarin new york. this has been a service fiasco.first, the suite layout is odd - a small angled bedroom with a long hallway and small sitting area. very chopped up space so ends up feeling quite small.we checked in and rushed upstairs to catch the end of the playoffs and neither tv had a signal. my fianc√© went nuts. a technician had to come up and fix it. not a great way to start a getaway.then i tried to stream a show from netflix and wifi was painfully slow. i called down but no help. someone called the next morning from it and tinkered with something but it didn't help so i called again tonight and was put on a 10 minute hold by the front desk. then was asked who i was holding for. then was switched to talk directly with their wifi help company - after giving my ipad info he declared the issue was not my device's fault. it was on their end and above his tech level and gave me a ticket number to retain if it didn't get fixed. who wants to do all this on a relaxing vacation at a luxury hotel? issue still hasn't been addressed.also the housekeeper walked in and woke us up earlier, turning on the lights when they came in while we napped.we hoped this would be an amazing stay but sadly service is everything.we just came back from a night's stay at the mandarin! we came a few years ago when it was called the mansion and not much has changed except they put larger tv's in which took out one of the coolest feature of the room. they had a museum quality art screen that covered the flat screen tv that was on the wall. you pushed a button to have the screen/painting to go up or down.the service was still wonderful. even though we were there for just one night, almost everyone knew our names and were extremely friendly. when we went to view our premiere room with a balcony (814), it was great! it was a corner room so when we entered it was split with the bathroom down a small hallway and our bedroom off the small entryway. the room was large with 2 sets of windows and a balconly overlooking hot atlanta!the bathroom was large and had a window above the soaking tub that overlooked phipps plaza and had an automatic screen that came down for privacy. the towels were even outstanding at 6 ft long!great hotel, nothing better than mandarin oriental in the world. mandarin oriental atlanta is charming. love the staff, the quaint restaurant, the pool and the spa. love the charm of the hotel, would recommend to anyone.excellent small hotel, great location. stayed many times and almost always perfect. they now have tesla charger in their garage which is very handy...........................................................stayed for a few days and really enjoyed it. the service was faultless and the room was very nice. i was tired and opted for room service instead of going down to the restaurant but the food was great.wasn't so keen on the surrounding area - it's more of a suburb and there didn't seem to be that much around except for some bars and shopping malls.i've stayed here many times before and was very disappointed when we pulled up to see the mansion next door and dante's gone. little did i know how disappointed i would be at 7:15am when the drilling started just outside my window. we also don't have the oversized vehicle parking due to construction on the other side so as far as i'm concerned all the amenities are gone. pain to park, loads of construction noise and no coffee maker in the rooms. i wouldn't stay here again if i had to choose. many other nice hotels that are quiet and have a lot\" to park in. typical over development, and swallowing of historic establishments, i'll miss dante!!\"check in was easy. lots of service there and getting to our rooms. i brought someone along who never experienced this property and she went nuts over her room and the amenities. we hated to leave but we will always stay here when in atlanta.unlike the ritz, four seasons, loews, and st. regis, the mandarin was not a crowd scene. go across the courtyard to del friscos if you want to shout above the din. this is a top notch but quiet hotel. everything is extraordinarily clean and modern, and the spa is terrific. no better hot tub in town. seemingly owning this hotel to ourselves, the treatment in the restaurant and bar was great. the only criticism i could offer is not to charge $34 for parking, while denying us the right to self park. just raise the room price and stop offending me and cutting down on your valets' tips because of the ridiculous charge. this is suburban atlanta, not downtown san francisco.we're still sitting in lobby at 5:00, check in time is 3:00. tessa voget the front desk supervisor released us to the lobby over an hour a go and has not even been here to check on us. no offer of any refreshments, anything. we have a 6:00 engagement this evening, guess we should have tried motel 6. i am sure it is a nice hotel, we may neve know.when i booked this it hadnt yet been taken over by mo. so was a surprise on arrival, would have been nice to have been emailed in advance. room large, well equipped and usual mandarin oriental style and facilities. pool area makes use of the basement.. but nicely done. spa good as expected. within close distance of shopping area, only gripe is the additional expense of parking. when i have paid this much to stay i dont expect it to be so painful! we had breakfast, but not as impressed as i expected. service slow and had to ask multiple times for things which was frustrating...did not feel cared for.very nice hotel and rooms. limited on-site dining facilities and the mandatory valet parking charge of $32 per night is ridiculous with no alternative self parking options available.we just came back froma night's stay at the mansion and we will definitely be back! the service was wonderful. even though we were there for just one night, almost everyone knew our names and were extremely friendly. when we went to view our premiere room with a balcony (706), it was great! it was a corner room so when we entered it was split with the bathroom down a small hallway and our bedroom off the small entryway. the room was large with 2 sets of windows and a balconly overlooking lenox suare and phipps plaza. one of the coolest feature of the room was the museum quality screen that covered the flat screen tv that was on the wall. it was just like being in the move the thomas crowne affair!the bathroom was large and had a window above the soaking tub that overlooked phipps plaza and had an automatic screen that came down for privacy. the towels were even outstanding at 6 ft long!we purchased the romance package and someone even went to the effort to call me during the week to ask when the champagne and condiments could be delivered. now that is service! we went to the ritz buckhead last year and they were carting down the halls the wine and condiments they offered just like you would on an assembly line!we had a drink at the bar and this is the only negative thing i could think of. they advertised that a grammy winning artist would sing at 8 pm but he still wasn't even ready at 8:20 so we had to leave for our restaurant reservation which was at 8:30.the next morning we had breakfast at the hotel and it was wonderful. they only issue there was that there wasn't a coffee maker in the room and i thought it was mentioned in the ammenities of the room. when i come back, i'll be sure to mention that we want a coffee maker in room and i'm sure they will accomodate our requests!stayed at the mansion for two nights on business. lives up to high standard of any rosewood hotel. fine service, comfortable room, solid food. location in buckhead is quite good, across from a mall and plenty of other restaurants. great for business travelers - not sure if i'd bring my family here for vacation.positives:* enjoyed indoor swimming pool. perfect temperature to sneak in a quick swim before/after work. i had the pool to myself in the morning and night. you do have to take a couple elevators to get there, but not a big deal. simple two lane lap pool, so good for exercise, less appropriate for recreational use.* breakfast was excellent. ordered room service in the morning, which was prompt and delicious. eggs and grits were great.* room was clean, comfortable bed. no complaints. easy stay.negatives.* taxi wait was a bit long to get out.* tv was a bit slow to operate/navigate.my partner and i spent two nights at this hotel recently........passing through atlanta for the weekend to do some shopping. our flight into atlanta was cancelled so we arrived on a later flight and arrived at the hotel on a friday evening around 9:50 pm. the valet was our first employee encounter and i knew right away this was going to be a really nice stay. at check-in the front desk person was very professional and kind knowing we had had a long day. we ask her what time craft, the hotel restaurant closed - she indicated 10 pm but told us she would call the restaurant to let them know we were on our way and allow us to have dinner - way beyond the call of duty but very much appreciated. the hotel is beautiful and the accomodations are very nice..........a luxury hotel for me is a great bed, quiet room and wonderful staff...........this is a luxury hotel. getting back to the staff i would like to thank the general manager - he or she has to be european trained in the hotel business..................they have done an incredible job of finding and training a wonderful group of people...................oh.........one other thing ...the hostess in the breakfast restaurant is the sweetest most delightful young lady you will ever encounter.......if you stay here you must have breakfast because if she is on duty............she will make your day.i have stayed here in the past and it was great. but this time was horribly different!!! i booked weeks in advance over the telephone with the hotel directly to book the romantic package for my wife and i on a special occasion. this packaged included a romantic bed turndown with rose petals and champagne. the day prior to arrival a representative emailed me confirming the time for turn down on my second night of the stay etc etc.when my wife and i arrived on friday night the receptionist promptly asked me about the special turn down service in front of my wife, somewhat cluelessly that it should be a romantic surprise. but that wasn't a problem, next came the surprise the manager appeared and told us he was sorry but they did not have a room for us that night that they had overbooked five reservations too many that night!!! they put us up in the four seasons in atlanta but the four seasons in atlanta is in a not as diserable location and is quite dated therefore is not in any league with not only the mansions but any of a couple of hotels directly across the street from the mansions.the next day we were able to check in and to be fair the manager did upgrade us to a room with a balcony, but that night when we came back from a romantic dinner and the rose petals were laid out they had forgotten the champagne!!!!!!we have traveled all over the world and stayed in many hotes and never had such a horrible experience with any hotel but much less such a supposedly nice hotel.you will be better off staying at either the intercontinental, the ritz in buckhead or the grand hyatt.had stayed at the mansion in august. we had attended one of the large shows in town. typically stay in buckhead and one of our friends told us we should check out this new hotel. the doormen are great, greeted warmly and opens to the door. you walk into a small very sterile entrance and are checked in at the front desk. the lower floor is like maze. the bar is an afterthought, it is small and narrow and lacks energy. we were the only one's in it except for a few old men. the hotel is not a mansion but one of the highest towers in the city. we had booked a suite and this is where we were dissapointed. this tainted the rest of my stay. the hotel are the lower floors of the building. condos have the top portion and with it the view. the view from our suite was of a malls' roof top and parking deck and of the westin hotel across the street. the restaurant craft is not open yet either. you see them working on it below. the executive suite is not a suite but a large bedroom, an entrance and a bathroom. this should not be called a suite but a large oversized bedroom. there is no loveseat or sofa, just a bed, desk chair and nightstands. the newspaper we requested was never delivered. the tv is concealed behind a very nice oil painting. this is very quirky, it is not positioned correctly in the room to watch the tv from the bed. it is to the side and over the desk. you also have to use 2 remote controls to operate this thing. butler service is touted on the website but does not compare to the ritz's club level service. at the ritz you get a real breakfast and you can get wine. here at the mansion, they claim a continental breakfast, hardly. they really need to beef up the butler service if they are going to compete with the ritz. the spa is very nice, one of the nicest i have seen. the problem with the spa is i have very sensitive skin and i am loyal to some specific products. this spa only carries product by the mondavis. since we were in town for business, i could not risk having a facial with the mondavi product. had dinner in neo, again, a very sterile experience. everything is white and the artwork is modern and has nothing to do with an italian restaurant. the food is good, the service is slow. it overlooks a garden and the garden is beautiful. we were placed in a corner and did not have a view of the garden, even though we were one of the few in it. i typically do not write a bad review, it is just tht this hotel lacks so many things. the name is deceiving, the suite is not a suite, the hotel lacks energy, the staff is slow. we actually went to the ritz to have drinks so we could feel the energy from buckhead that we like. oh, and buckhead is all torn up. in five years, i expect it will be rebuilt, they have torn out all the bars and restaurants in the old party district and will be putting in fancy new stores that will obviously rob the malls of their good stores. midtown at the four seasons is where i will be staying next.we had stayed at the rosewood property in cabo san lucas (las ventanna)in 2006 and had a great time. so when we received a brochure describing their new property in atlanta ga we were interested. the silver tray service\" included in their rosewood escape package was very appealing to my wife so we booked that. we drove down and were warmly greeted by the bellman. the front desk check in was good. they asked what paper i preferred to receive. the usa today was standard and i requested the ny times also. we went up to our room and our luggage was delivered by the bellman who said our butler would soon arrive to explain the technology in the room to us and describe the \"silver tray service\". timothy was our butler. when i asked about the \"silver tray service\" he stated that i did not have these services. after disagreeing with me for a few minutes he left, and i was about to call the front desk. timothy then called back and said he was mistaken and in fact i did pay for the \"silver tray service\". timothy never did explain the technology in the room. (the tv was hidden behind a painting which was neat but it was at an odd angle from the bed which made the remote difficult to operate). the silver tray service was spotty. sometimes it worked as promised and sometimes it did not. i had requested the breakfast at 7:30 am. the first morning it worked great, the second morning they forgot and i had to call and request it and then they forgot to deliver the ny times. the third morning it worked as planned. the \"silver tray service\" promises continental breakfast with coffee or tea, a mid-day snack and hors d'oeuvres with an evening cordial. when i read this it sounds like 3 services a day, but we only received 2 services a day. the neo restaurant was great (they need to wash their windows) and there was a lovely english garden. i went to the atlanta history center and the hotel's car took me and picked me up. that was a nice touch. the hotel sends you a form to fill out if you have any special request. my wife and i were celebrating our wedding anniversary and her birthday which i stated in the online form. we had read other reviews that said great things about similar occasions. i don't believe the form was ever read until the last day. as i was checking out the front desk asked how our anniversary had been. over all a beautiful hotel with a great location if you want to walk to the nearby shopping malls, but i would not recommend the \"silver tray service\".\"have stayed in much nicer luxury hotels. renovations were noisy. we were not told if this until after checkin w/a message on our hotel phone. room service very pricey. room a bit small for a luxury hotel.breakfast service was a little slow. my boss and i had to wrap up a meeting by 9am and get on the road to our next meeting. i looked over several times to get the check, but no one came over. in the end, i had to walk up to the maitre d desk at 8:55am and paid the check. gym is 24 hours, but pool closes early. pool signs were posted all the way inside the pool. i tried to go to the pool, but it was closed. i had to walk over to the reception to find out that pool was closed.i recently stayed at the four seasons atlanta on a business trip. like all four seasons, the service was excellent, and the bedding was sublime. the bar margot was a great place to unwind after a long day, and i loved the cacio and pepe pasta. no complaints about the wifi, the fitness room, or the room service breakfast. but i have to say: i am not a fan of the renovation. to me, the whole linear, grey, modern look, cheapens the hotel overall. the furniture also felt modular and cheap‚äînot at all like a typical four seasons. i was also particularly unhappy with my room ‚äî the supposedly higher end city terrace room. the terrace was not at all private and looked out onto a construction site. while the room was supposed to be a corner, the view on the side was to a building so close as to block the sun. (i have attached photos of the terrace front and side view.). also, the room was adjacent to a housekeeping station that was kept open and was the source of a lot of noise. that noise, combined with the 9 am construction noise, meant a lot of distractions during my morning work time. my final complaint involves my departure. the printer was not working, so i waited 15 mins for a copy of my bill. i was cutting it close to my flight so i asked the front desk to call for a waiting cab, which they promised they had done. when i went out front: no cabs anywhere, and when an uber finally arrived, the valets had blocked the exit with the cars of arriving, unpacking guests. it was another 20 mins just to leave. i made my flight by one minute. not ideal.we stayed at this hotel for our wedding night on saturday, 8/11 at the recommendation of my brother and sister-in-law who stayed here for their wedding night in may 2017. i completed a credit card authorization form to allow my wedding coordinator to drop our bags and check us into the hotel at 3 pm. to my surprise, she was not given the keys to our room. when we arrived at midnight, the front desk was unfriendly and unhelpful as to why we had not been checked-in to our room. for $400 a night, while in my wedding dress, i expected some level of hospitality from this hotel. additionally, despite numerous emails from the hotel leading up to our stay asking if we were checking in for a special occasion (and me saying that it was our wedding night), there was nothing special about our room or any additional level of service for this once-in-a-lifetime event (bottle of champagne, note, etc.) i will never stay here again and will not recommend this hotel to family and friends.i had heard this about the four seasons but actually witnessed it myself. i asked the front desk for directions to the restaurant so i may have breakfast. he told me to take the elevators up to the 2nd floor\". immediately behind me a man asked the exact same question (he had a european accent) and the directions were \"go to the elevators behind the pillars, go to the 3rd floor and the restaurant will be to your immediate right\". now mind you, i was standing at the elevator bank for the garage the entire time and he never told me the correct instructions, so i just followed the other guy.we get to the restaurant together and he requested to be seated inside and i sat outside (they thought we were together at first and of course greeted him although i was clearly in front of him).i was offered a water and a menu......yep, that's it. never was my order taken. it was time for my spa appointment (30 minutes later) so i told them no thanks and it was time for me to leave.they said it was a miscommunication with the host stand (not busy and only a few tables were occupied), so they sent a pastry and a cup of yogurt down to the spa for me.this was a treat to myself for my birthday. not exactly how i wanted to be treated but at least now i know to go elsewhere when i want to be treated extra special.\"my family & i stayed here and left in june. we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and were looking forward to visiting a place, atlanta, we have never been. before checking into the hotel i interacted with melissa, from reservations, who was very helpful and quite pleasant to work with. i also interacted with mckenzie, who is extremely helpful as a concierge!on our second day there we visited several of the tourist sites: botanical gardens, world of coca-cola and the georgia aquarium. after a full day of site seeing we returned to the hotel with plans to eat dinner at the hotel and recharge. as i was walking up the stairs to the restaurant i was confronted by someone who said i could not bring my camera into the restaurant... and soon told me i was not even welcome in the hotel. i was a bit confused so i went to the front desk and asked for the manager on duty. i explained to him what just happened and expected him to say, there was some confusion but i was welcome at the hotel and restaurant.. to my surprise he told me that other man was correct... now i was even more confused and getting angry. in any case, i had a hungry nine year-old and wife who was tired. so i walked to south city kitchen in the rain, and was not offered an umbrella when i left the hotel..i was so angry i wrote a letter to the president of the four seasons, allen smith. i tried to explain i have stayed at least a dozen other four seasons and had pictures on my ipad that i shared with him. i also prepaid my visit to the hotel and was beyond puzzled as to what happened..when i checked out on monday i was informed by the manager they had a vip event on friday and thought i was a paparazzi because i had a camera. in full disclosure they then gave me a $700 gift card, which really does not mean very much to me. the person who confronted me and the manager on duty could have quickly looked to see i was a guest, could have seen that i had pictures on my ipad of us at other four seasons and i had a nine-year old girl and my wife with me.. he then saw me then next night (saturday) as i was going out to eat and could have apologized for the misunderstanding but chose not to.after the fact we received an apology from hotel manager and general manager but the two people who offended us never said a word. i even told the manager when i was there, all i really expected was an genuine apology but never received one.as i told the gm, that hotel is one of the least expensive four seasons i have visited and i really valued the time i spend with my family and this experience left me beyond disappointed so $700 essentially meant nothing.until i stayed here, i felt like the four seasons was a special place for me and my family; much like how my daughter felt at disney world.. i even influenced my team to hold our christmas party at the four seasons in buenos aires last year along with business meetings at other locations. i think the management team genuinely felt bad about this but there was more than one person who could have rectified it and chose not to.. at the same time there were a few very good people at this property, notably mckenzie and melissa; but this experience brought me to a crossroad to reflect on the four seasons for me..the four seasons atlanta is a nice hotel, better than most, but compared to other four seasons has a lot wrong. certain things in the room were not up to par... soap in the shower was not replaced, and was replaced only after 3 days. the beds were extremely uncomfortable, and the same goes for their pillows. the beds were also very small. one of the things advertised on their website, a garden terrace where they grow their own ingredients, was not known by the staff. the staff had no idea, and apparently, one of the highlights of their hotel was closed for the season. on the last day, we found out about their house car which could drive anywhere within a 6 mile radius. this was fun to find out about but upsetting after we had spent money on lyft for 5 days. one of the highlights of our stay was the locker rooms. the locker rooms were very nice, and were stocked with amenities. the pool was nice for indoor pools.i was really looking forward to returning to this hotel after a 5 year absence. used to be one of the best places to stay in atlanta. this time, they gave me a room with a very strong dog odor. when i asked to switch, i got lazy, apathetic service and another room that smelled bad. i think they reserve the 5th floor for guests who have pets or got a good deal. ended up staying in the second room with the unpleasant odor, leaky shower and unbearably slow internet. another example of how poor management can turn a 5 star property into a 4 star with lazy leadership and service.last week was my third stay at the four seasons atlanta. if it had been my first, it might also have been my last.i'm a huge fan of four seasons properties generally, and previously had great experiences at the one in atlanta. i really love this hotel in many respects, but they fell down unbelievably when it came to service.i arrived at about 3:45 p.m. the other day, only to be told my room wasn't ready (despite having been guaranteed\" that it would be ready by 3:00). i explained that i really needed to be in my room to get some work down that afternoon. the front desk told me i could wait in the bar or the business center. they then found a room for me that had been vacated and said they would expedite the cleaning of that room so i could get in as soon as possible. two hours later, i called and spoke with the same person who promised to expedite the room cleaning. he acted as though he and i had never spoken, then said my room would be ready \"within the hour\" -- i.e., up to three hours after i arrived. i complained to the check working behind the bar, robert, and he intervened on my behalf. so i finally got to my room at about 6:00 p.m. their excuse was that a large party was all given a 5:00 p.m. checkout time -- even though the hotel was completely sold out. so we \"little people\" (who only spent $4,000 or so dollars at the hotel that week) were just out of luck.the next morning, i ordered breakfast, and my coffee cup arrived with lipstick stains all over it. at least i got coffee; later in the week, when i ordered breakfast again, they forgot the coffee completely. one evening after a long day at work, i stopped by the bar to get a glass of wine to take up to my room. the bartender (the bar was clearly understaffed for that time of day) said she would be with me right away before disappearing to serve other customers and chit-chat with her colleagues. i finally gave up and left. and when you do get a drink at the bar, beware the short pours: as has always been a problem with this hotel, you get very little bang for your buck when ordering a drink like whiskey.again, there are many things i love about the hotel, and the staff are uniformly friendly. special thanks to robert as well as bartenders eric and emily, who were all fantastic. but i expect a much higher degree of service than i experienced at this hotel (especially having received that degree of service in the past). i am willing to give the four seasons atlanta another try, and hope this was just a bad week for them. but i do hope they read this and see what they need to fix.\"the service was tremendous. everyone was friendly and helpful. the room was beautiful. my wife had several spa treatments and had nothing but good things to say. ladies, get the facial. the only negative was the pool was closed for repairs.beautiful hotel in a great part of town. great service with friendly staff. the room was very clean and quiete. we are not what you would call needy\" hotel guests. we don't need much or ask for anything just a comfortable place to stay. this was perfect! several wonderful restaurants within walking distance and boutique shopping a few miles away. we were in atlanta for the porsche driving experience. the four seasons and porsche have an unbeatable deal. that is how we ended up staying here. would definitely come back!\"i travel quite often and stay either at a ritz or the four seasons. i have to say that the hotel lacked a simple feature which would have gave it a 5. there needs to be coffee set up in the lobby even if it's for a nominal charge . the little things that set this chain apart were missing.not worth the effort. don't waste your time or money at the four seasons hotel. the service is sub par for any motel much less a supposedly 5 star hotel. asked to be contacted by the hotel's management. as of 2 weeks today. i have not been contacted.in a decent area of atlanta and starbucks is right next door. i ordered room service during my stay and they were timely at bringing the food, but untimely when it came to picking up the leftovers. i was also charged via the wrong payment method post check out from spa services. overall a decent stay.great hotel typically four seasons room and service had a bed and breakfast package that was not as advertised and issues with front desk and restaurant attendant in the end worked out but not a good experience and not expected at such a pricey hotel.this hotel is gorgeous with spacious and comfortable rooms.the best part was the service illustrated the moment we stepped out of the car. our luggage was promptly brought to our room, but i had forgotten my hanging items. i was concerned as we had just a few minutes minutes to meet our reserved time at a nearby restaurant. it was no problem for the staff....within minutes the gentleman had retrieved my items and even phoned the restaurant saying we would be delayed. you will feel like royalty.....a feature the four season's hotels are known for and displayed by this atlanta hotel.after checkout, and following the final session of a business conference, i returned to the hotel for my bags and car. thanks to uneven pavement about a block away, i stumbled and rather badly bloodied my hands, despite the sunny and dry conditions. when i got to the hotel, staff insisted on taking me to the spa to get cleaned up, brought bandages, and were very helpful in getting my stuff to my car, as my hands were not completely functional. couldn't have been nicer to this already-checked-out guest!no concierge room. no coffee/tea etc in room. no extra bath amenities like mouth wash, more bottled water available. rediculous to have to go to the fitness room for coffee/tea/water. very little seating in the lobby.i travel around 150 days per week on business, most of the time in latin america (mexico all the way to argentina). so as a platinum / diamond member in most of the hotel chains, i can say i have a good reference to compare hotels.i was with a high expectations when i arrive at this hotel. nice brand, nice property and great location. this high expectations start to meltdown quickly....the gym is the most outdated you can imagine. worse that any marriott fairfield in or spg four points i ever stayed. probably the machines were bought 20 or maybe 30 years ago! there was no yoga mat at the gym ?!?!?!?!next day for breakfast, it took 45 min to get a fruit plate with omelette and an espresso!!! believe or not, the hotel in a tuesday had not a buffet breakfast?!?!?!the whole experience continued after check out. i left the hotel and received my folio via email. to my surprise, the same super slow breakfast was also super expensive, since i was charged twice... i call the hotel and they agreed to check with the restaurant and return to me with their confirmation, which i never received.so i send one, two and three emails to the hotel, buy again no response. i finally call them again and they said that they had credit back the extra charge. how much would had cost them to reply to my emails or give me a call to confirm that????from atlanta, i did a quick 3 hours connection in miami and left to another business trip in mexico. now i am enjoying a great service, nice gym a fantastic buffet breakfast in a room rate that is 3 times cheaper than the atlanta four seasons. life is good!!!my wife and i checked into the hotel for an unplanned stopover during a short trip to the area. we booked a one bedroom suite, a two room setup. we arrived late after a dinner nearby and went to the room at about 10pm. room 1719 was clean and spacious, and appointed well. by 12:30pm i decided to sleep on the sofa on the adjacent room and at 1pm my wife decided to sleep on the bathroom floor as the elevator system ended up being behind a wall next to the bed, and the noise and vibration the 2 cars made wasn't noticeable with the tv on before bed, but once that was off, it sounded like a street car in sf. then a heavy construction project about 250 ft away and adjacent the hotel, commenced work at 7 am. cement trucks, a 150 foot crane drilling footings and excavators beeping while backing up, shortened sleep further.it should be mandatory to inform guests of such possible sleep interruptions, the main reason for paying for a hotel room. it would have been good to know.terrible night's sleep for $739.we arrived on st. patrick's day. the pub next door was blasting music all night, and the staff changed the location of our room. the bar was lively, the restaurant for breakfast was beautiful and had a variety of breakfast options. the bar was lively and the food was good, but a bit complex for a bar/lounge, as the tables were low cocktail tables and not great for a full meal.great hotel, great staff! while traveling to atlanta on business i had the pleasure to visit the four season's atlanta. great hotel, great staff, nice rooms. while in atlanta i choose to stay no where else.hotel is beautiful, rooms spacious but breakfast is seriously lacking! at $50-$60 a pop for one person, breakfast should give you all the energy to start a serious work day! instead, it was delivered to my room cold, lacking in flavor and just plain awful. i was too busy to let management know as i had an early meeting.the next morning i went downstairs for breakfast, in an effort to give it another chance. not to mention i did not know if there were any good spots close by to grab a bite to eat. i ordered the pancakes. they were overcooked and sprinkled with powered sugar to cover up\" their dark appearance. when i asked for new pancakes, they came out beautiful in color, but noticeably smaller!why, that is the way to show the customer how you really feel! i spoke to the manager who offered a 10% reduction in the price....wow!the hotel emailed me a survey. when i did not respond, they sent another. i called instead to speak with yvette thomas henry, the gm. she had someone else to return my call so i shared with them my experiences. crickets in terms of the response!!lunch & dinner was delicious and ramsey is the best server ever! if he were in management, the whole operation would be different! 4 sure! so why the \"terrible\" rating? because breakfast is the most important meal of the day!\"what can we say? the gift show books up the town and we couldn't get into the four seasons this year [as we had last year] but, still staying nearby and being very disappointed with our hotel's [the w midtown] breakfast, we walked over - on 2 days - to a very enjoyable breakfast, with great service, at the four seasons. we'll stay here next time in atlanta for sure ....as other recent reviewers have said, i am a four season's fan. and, have particularly been loyal to the one in midtown atlanta. however, so much has changed in the past year or so.first, they've closed their restaurant (park 75) except for breakfast and sunday brunch. it's only possible to get a poor substitute of small plates plus for limited hours in the bar. is this suddenly a three star hotel? well, the location and wonderful staff made up for this, we thought, until we returned from an evening of entertainment around 10:30 p.m. and couldn't even order dessert. our server told us that, as guests, we could go up to our room and order from a limited dessert menu and enjoy it in the room instead of with fresh coffee and company (so inviting!).as others have stated, the staff are always well-trained and attentive. we appreciate that. however, we took a walk around midtown atlanta to check out other hotels for future visits before we left. the four seasons is in a perfect area, but the lack of a true restaurant and the limited hours the bar kitchen is open is likely to discourage us from staying here in the near future. which is a shame, as we've had many happy visits to this four seasons in the past.having been to many four seasons around the world, i had high expectations for the one in atlanta. off the bat, i knew that the atlanta four seasons was a poor representation of what i'd come to expect. during check in, the credit card system was down and the man helping us had to resort to using an old fashioned carbon machine to get us checked in. it took forever and he eventually had to get help.we were taken to the 5th floor where we noticed water vac machines and hoses. it signaled trouble. sure enough, while my associates and i were in a business meeting, our rooms were evacuated due to flooding. we were told that our things had already been moved for us. i was not thrilled at the notion of strangers handling my toothbrush and other personal belongings to say the least. as we attempted to freshen up from our work day, we discovered that the water had been completely turned off in the hotel. we were unable to flush the toilet, brush our teeth or shower after a long day of traveling and business meetings. dinner was on property. i looked forward to a cocktail to settle my nerves and noticed a black floater in my drink. it appeared to be mold from the ice machine. i sent it back and got a new drink. same thing happened again. it then occurred to me that if the water was turned off in the rooms, was it also turned off in the kitchen? could they wash their hands??after dinner, i returned to my room and was glad to see the toilets were flushing and i had cold water to brush my teeth. no hot water to take a much desired shower though.i was glad to be leaving the hotel after one night. never thought i would ever say that about a four seasons property! i anticipated an apology, maybe even a comped overnight parking or breakfast for the inconvenience. i got nothing. truly a shameful representation of an otherwise excellent brand.for some reason i had always heard that the four seasons hotel was supposed to be better than the ritz carlton. i feel like this hotel was slightly lower than what i get from a ritz carlton. we had several issues during our stay, most of which they made immediate corrections for, but no one ever remembered my name, when i stay at the ritz carlton most associates remember me and my name.i was slightly disappointed with the four seasons atlanta, i won't choose this hotel again.we were very impressed by our stay. we normally stay at the loews or w but changed things up with this visit. james the hotel car driver was incredible. customer service during our stay could not have been better.the old saying is that you get what you pay for... it's true here... perfect location... outstanding service from the car to the door to check-in to the room... a four seasons room... clean, quiet and comfortable... a perfect 3 days... things i would change... the automatic rotating lobby door sometimes surprised me and started to rotate before i was in a wedge\"... i would add a night light in the bathroom ... hay, i am 74 abg get up at night... that's it folks... it's perfect...\"what can i say? i've stayed at fairmont, ritz carlton, trump and other top hotels and was excited to visit my first four seasons. i had always heard of the exceptional service and elegant rooms. well, i cannot say how disappointing and i will never, ever stay at another four seasons. to start, the room and furnishings were dated - seemed like it was stuck in the 80s -looked like a dated hyatt. although a one bedroom suite with 1.5 bath, the shower was the smallest and most uncomfortable shower i have been in my entire adult life. no kidding, the shower was 3x3. you could not step away from the shower head to soap yourself. there was mold in the bathroom ceiling. however, my first negative impression was when i walked into the elevators. the stench was so bad, that i asked my daughter to smell my breath, shoes and back, because i was afraid that perhaps i smelled or had stepped in something, as it smelled like vomit. i did not fathom it was the elevator until we walked into the elevators a second time and it was, sadly, the running joke during our stay.now, the famed service? well, it was some of the worst i have experienced at a so called 4 or 5 star hotel. the hotel was obviously understaffed. when i called valet, there was no answer and was sent to front desk. trying to advise i called valet but that it had rung through to the front desk and before completing my sentence, the front desk transferred me to valet and again it rang through only to end up with concierge where i finally had a chance to explain and finally had them help to call for my car. when we called for room service, it was the first hotel that could not take our order (not once, but twice during our stay), but said it would call us back. one time, it took 5 minutes for room service to call back. in summary, not the accommodations or service one expects at a 3 star hotel, much less a 4 or 5 star hotel. if atlanta is an aberration, four seasons should renovate the hotel, provide sufficient staff and retrain or alternatively remove its flag from this location.gorgeous property, friendly staff, beautiful lounge/bar!! the food also was excellent at the lounge!! very good chef!! very large, beautiful rooms, comfortable beds with upscale linens!! large gorgeous bathroom!! beautiful view of downtown!! the price was not bad at all for a true five star hotel!! we stayed there for a one night layover in atlanta!! but believe me if i am in atlanta this is where i will be staying!!i left my shoes in the room when i checked out and realized i had 5 hours later when i reached home. security / housekeeping couldn't find it. i would've expected more from a 5 star hotel that charges over $250 a night.we arrived early at 10:30 am and needed to drop off our two boys (16 and 18). our room was not ready. the reception staff found a temporary room for the boys (as my wife and i had to leave for a tee time) and then moved them when our room was ready. most accomodating and appreciated.i did the four seasons experience packagepros- location, complimentary sparking drinks, courteous front desk staff, option to choose the music and adjust the volume to your liking during your treatmentcons- unfortunately too many to call it a four star experience. the nail salon is small and disorganized. my aesthetician kept opening multiple drawers to find stuff, color selection is very limited, she ran the file on my heels for literally a few seconds but then was distracted and ran it over inside of my ankle joint.said she is not used to the new silver files. no instruments were disposable or in sterilized packs. i was bleeding in the salon, manager did not even make a courtesy appearance to apologize, the aestheticians braids kept coming in the way of removing my nail paint. all the products applied were cold. she rubbed them between her hands first so that by the time she applied on my skin all i felt was her hands.her own nails were terrible and the nail paint was applied sloppily with my nails showing around the edges.i left the salon with an abrasion bad enough that i could not walk around town in sneakers the next day and my fingernails looked like someone did them on the train. the spa lunch choices are poor with limited detox/healthy options. poolside lunch seating was nice except that there were hair around where i sat and ate lunch. the relaxation room is small like you would expect in a a much smaller salon/spa with only one chaise. the masseuse kept putting her arm around me while walking with me to and back from the massage room which i guess was meant to be a nice gesture but made me uncomfortable. her massage technique was great though. at one point the masseuse put a hot towel wrap on my body which initially was too hot as she didn't air it and even though i kept saying it is uncomfortable, she kept saying it will get better, i kept it off my body with my hands and toes! it got better and then it lay on me- wet and cold while the scalp massage continued, not nice!! the facial left me with a glowing skin as promised.she was very good with explaining everything she did. however, she was turning on the water to wash her stuff every time she applied something on my face, it was very annoying to hear the water running and the things being cleaned, i would have preferred to relax! most 4 star spas have 30 min between treatments to cleanup so that the client's relaxation time is not disrupted. the bathrooms are nice and clean, great idea to have a drying and changing area in the shower stall. the grout however was gross and made me thankful that i was not staying in and using the hotel bathrooms. it would would have been thoughtful to have hand lotion/ facial moisturizer, body scrub and make up remover in the bathroom. overall a very below average experience. i have been to many 4-5 star spas in nyc/sf/dc/chicago and even average salon spas. four seasons did not feel like a four star experience- lacking in hygiene/courtesy and simply the little details that make a an all day spa experience fun and relaxing. i would give them the benefit of doubt if it was one service that was lacking. also when the spa manager/ director don't care enough to step out and apologize when you leave with an abrasion you leave feeling unsatisfied and unhampered- exactly opposite of what it should be, would not recommend to friends and family!jacuzzi closes at 11pm which sucks since it was valentines day night!!! this was not posted on the website and the pool and jacuzzi was the main reason why we went there. no one greeted us with respect just cause we didn't look like all the other rich people.she is so embarrassed by this hotel treatment; she just told me about this when i suggested to use this hotel again.my daughter made reservations on line a month in advance to celebrate her 21 birthday at your hotel (april 25, 2014). she even went by prior to see the room to make sure it will accommodate her celebration. she purchase the birthday package to include chocolate covered strawberries, champagne, breakfast for two, spa credits and early check in; however, none of the package was honored ($824) without calling and complaining. her bill charged for breakfast and no discount was given for the spa as indicated on the web site($1400+).she arrived at the hotel at 12:00 and had to wait until after 3:30 pm to get to her room. she had to run to her spa appointment. when she returned to her room, the strawberries and champagne was not in the room. she had to call for them. no one appeared to have knowledge of the details of her reservations.the next morning only a breakfast for one was delivered to the room and received a late charge of $96 for this meal.recently stayed at the four seasons midtown. the stay started off great. per usual their staff is awesome and very attentive. but the stay went down hill when we went to visit the spa. first i scheduled two hot stone pedicures, when i arrived i was told that they had me down for the signature pedicures. was not pleased even though the nail tech did do an awesome job.. second, the main reason we we booked the spa appointment was so that my wife and i could enjoy the pool area. my wife is pregnant and couldn't use the steam room, sauna or hot tub, so we were really excited about spending time in the pool together. unfortunately, we could not swim together because someone had pooped in the pool. yes pooped in the pool... and i had gotten out of the pool just moments before they discovered the poop. so i'm pretty sure i was in a pool with poop floating around. the spa staff was really nice and professional about the whole situation but it really bombed my wife out. third, on multiple occasions we tried to order room service and the phone kept ringing to the front desk because no one was there in the kitchen to answer our calls, so we just ordered deliver twice from an italian and indian place.is it too much to ask for capable room service and no poop in the pool. i gave two stars because the room was nice and they treated my dog well.we have stayed several hotels in atlanta, but the four seasons is by far our best experience! staff was over the top! highly recommended! we did the porsche driving experience and the porsche package was perfect.loved this hotel until our last two visits. both times the bar that we have enjoyed so much in the past made us feel like we were in the ghetto .... lots of very loud foul language ...... i'm far from an angel but both my wife and i found this very offensive especially for a four seasons .... not once but twice.... it seams to have turned into a hangout for the elite members of the atlanta ghetto crowd. the management was un responsive when we expressed our concern at checkout. have not and will not return.the rooms, the staff and the amenities are first rate. the lack of a coffee maker in the room when one gets up at 5:00 was a mystery. the lighting in the bathroom was quite dim and the large screen television had very few channels.a wedding took me to the beautiful city of atlanta, the bride had selected the hotel.....a great location right near the high museum, just a few blocks away.....everything was just right. a grand view of the city from my room. outstanding service, good food and one interesting choice of dinning areas......lots of fresh flowers that made the interior even more special.........this guest enjoyed her stay and the selection of papers in the morning was most appreciated.....my visit didn't start out great when the front desk gave me the 3rd degree on me using a debit card with just my initials on it, even though they had my driver's license. i had to battle with them just to let me use my card! i would've just walked away and caught a cab to the ritz, but i had jet lag and wanted to rest. fast forward to the room. it's like a walking advertisement with everything having a price tag on it just to partake with what's in the room. no refrigerator just one fully stocked with, guess what, more priced items! the saving grace was the spa which was fab! but at the ritz the customer service is impeccable and it isn't forced. next time i will stay there instead and just cab over to somewhere for a massageit was a great disappointment to spend our holidays in four season hotel. i will not recommend my friends to stay in this hotel.guests have to order kettle, coffee and tea bags. only 1 bottle complimentary water was provided.i stayed with the four seasons back in october and i've been meaning to write a review of them for a while but haven't gotten around to it, until now.i'll start with the positives. the location was fantastic. the hotel was close to some great restaurants, and a nice park (which i forgot the name of...). it's close to the nightlife, without being too close to the point where it's too loud or too crowded. the service was generally good, and the room was spacious. the l'occitane toiletries were a nice touch.now onto what soured my entire first time experience with the four seasons. the hotel advertises a courtesy car that provides a complimentary ride to a destination within a 5 mile radius from the hotel, but did not advertise that the service is limited. i initially chose this hotel over its competitor for this extra service, which was not available for the entire weekend i was there because another guest was using the car. it is limited in time (i think it starts at 9am and ends at 10pm?), which is understandable, but it seemed like it was also severely limited in quantity. i have stayed in hotels with courtesy cars before and had not ran into this problem. i was disappointed that i was not able to use the service and had to pay for all my taxi expenses, which i was hoping to avoid.however, on top of that, there was one particular incident that really bothered me. i had called the front desk to call a cab for me, and they let me know to come down to the lobby promptly in 5 minutes (emphasizing promptly) because the cab was already there. i went down to the lobby immediately after the call since i was ready to go anyway, but there was no cab waiting for me when i got to the lobby. i think someone else had taken it right as i went down. the concierge told me that a cab will be arriving shortly, so i waited outside. 45, yes, you read right, fourty five minutes later, the concierge was finally able to hail a cab.i understand that in some cities you have to wait a long time to wait for a cab because cab service is limited, but after 10 minutes of waiting and no cab is around, it would have made sense for them to ask me to return to my room and wait there until a cab was hailed rather than tease me every five minutes telling me that one will arrive shortly.i'm sure the four seasons atlanta is a great hotel, but my personal experience was tainted by these events, which i'm sure are rare or else others would not be rating the hotel so highly.i actually filled out a negative customer feedback after my stay, and they were kind enough to call me back the day after. i was busy when they called, so the person who called me told me that he would contact me the day after, which he never did. i don't think he will ever call back by this point, so i ended up writing this review on tripadvisor.i normally love this hotel chain. however this one was a let down from the beginning. after a cancellation of my flight i had to break my trip and decided short noticed to spend the night there. usually the rooms are nice and cozy. not this one. i did care less as it was just for one night and i had to leave early in the morning to continue my trip. exhausted i decided to order room service which i was told comes from their signature restaurant in house. the food when it arrived was a joke, uneatable steak, cold sides and trimmings. i called room service back and told them about it. no apology, no offer to exchange,.....nothing. i was told they would take care of the charge. the next morning at check out, nothing was removed. i had to be over 30 minutes at the desk until someone took care of a portion of the bill (the steak). well, atlanta has plenty of hotels. however, other cities and four seasons experiences have been much better than this one!the hotel is comfortable and convenient. the fitness facilities and the pool are great. the staff is friendly and accommodating, although service at curve side seemed a bit confused. the lobby decor reminds me of some kind of temple to ancient gods, is a bit too too much, but actually i liked it for an outstanding hotel.the hotel is comfortable and convenient. the fitness facilities and the pool are great. the staff is friendly and accommodating, although service at breakfast seemed a bit confused.the lobby decor reminds me of some kind of temple to ancient gods, like one might find in ghostbusters. a bit too too much, but i suppose there is nothing that can be done about that now.....stayed here because of reputation, always wanted to stay at the four seasons. i typically like the w hotel or loews, more modern and hip\" hotels. the only complaint was the hotel was very traditional, with many older guests, and an older style. it does have a great terrace restaurant. we dined there and oprah was right next to us! restaurants behind the hotel in midtown are hip and casual, too. if you are a young couple, this hotel will be very boring for you. no doubt it's quiet for a sound night's sleep.\"my boyfriend and i decided to stay here after reading tons of rave reviews online. it was between the four seasons and the st. regis. however, we decided to stay at the four seasons because we had never stayed at one before and because of their so called car service\" that could transport us to and from dinner nearby. big mistake. we checked in late afternoon and had 9pm dinner reservations at a place that was within their car service range. i talked to the girl at the front desk and inquired more about the car service. she told me that i would just need to call down 15 minutes prior to when we needed to be taken to our dinner. she said that because of the range (a few mile radius) of where the car service went we would only have to wait 15 minutes at most. i called down around 7 asking if we could get the car to take us to dinner: we were just going to go early to have a drink at the bar. the concierge said that the car was \"on a run\" and he would have to call me back to let me know when the car would be available to take us to dinner. he called me back and said that the car was on \"an extended trip\" and would be back in 45 minutes...even though i was told when checking in that the car only ran a few mile radius!!! so, we just went down to the four season bar to have a drink while we waited very patiently. i called back at 8 and talked to the same guy at the concierge desk and he said that the car still wasn't back yet. we waited around 15 more minutes and walked down there to see for ourselves what the issue was. he said that the car wouldn't be back for another hour (that's right, i said hour!!) but he would be glad to call us a cab....!! gee, thanks! i am paying $300/night and would prefer to not have to pay an extra cab fare because the so called courtesy car has been gone for the last few hours!! he told me to call him when we finished dinner and he would send the car immediately! so, when we ordered dessert, we called the concierge only to find out the car stopped running at 10!!! we were given no explanations and apologies as to what the issues were. needless to say, we will stay at the st regis for future atlanta trips.\"we arrived to the hotel from new york expecting a place comparable to the nyc four seasons. they were very nice at check in and offered to upgrade us for $150 to a suite from the two deluxe connecting rooms we had booked. we accepted. the suite was just a step above a doubletree or a marriot- overlooking a construction site, very dated furniture, next to the elevators, etc. they told us we could access the wireless internet by entering our name and room number, but when we did we were told we had to pay $13 a day for the service. next, i was looking at the rate plan we booked with which guaranteed a complimentary\" upgrade if available. our upgrade was $150. everyone was very nice and we never saw another guest the whole time we were there, but when you are paying this much for a hotel room, they could give you the internet and the complimentary upgrade without charge. and they need to upgrade the rooms- they are very dated and tired looking.\"i had a 3 nights reservation and could not believe my eyes:we checked in to find out our room was half cleaned. bed sheets were still dirty and soiled from the previous staying guests. the toliet had stains which made me want to puke. the glasses provided in the room two of which had lipstick marks on them. and to add to the fun, in the morning, we were greeted by a friendly roach trampling through our room on the carpet from one end to the other. we packed our bags, checked out immediately and went directly to the st. regis atlanta where we should have gone in the first place; a true oasis for the discriminating business traveler. do not bother with this hotel nor with any four seasons hotels. what's happened to the four seasons chain?husband and i stayed here during valentines weekend. nice all around. nothing out of order and no complaints. heavy on the wallet but expected b/c it's the four seasons hotel right?! right.was visiting family and it happened to be our anniversary, so we thought a weekend at the 4 seasons would be nice. having spent a fair bit of time in four seasons overseas, was deeply disappointed in the problems we had, starting at checkin -- no one helped with bags at front door, room smelled like cigarette smoke, next room was loud because of nearby club, bad service at breakfast, etc.that said, the pool was nice, and my wife liked the spa.would have been passable for a courtyard marriott, but not at all what i expect from this chain.awesome stay at the hotel. staff was friendly and sweet. however, a couple days later, i checked my credit card statement and they overcharged us ~$100 for room service, valet, water, etc. that was included in the package we purchased. when we called to get it corrected, i was on hold for at least 30 min. being transferred from one person to the next until i spoke with an extremely rude accountant who acted like she was doing me a favor by correcting the charges. i offered to fax in the receipt which clearly shows the charges and the link to their own website that spells out what the package we purchased includes. will never stay here again because i dont want to deal with the wrongful charges afterwards.stayed with my girlfriends for a weekend getaway and enjoyed our stay! the plan was to reconnect with old friends and help one of our girlfriends pick a site for her wedding reception.the hotel had an impressive lobby, although very old-fashioned in colors: gold and marble...it was like 1980s or so? staff was very friendly. the spa facilities were beautiful,the treatments amazing and although the relaxation/ waiting area was small it was still cozy and inviting. our room was nice, clean, beds were out of this world, linen was crisp, very confortable, great toiletries. as a woman, i thought the hallway leading to our room was kind of dark.we had breakfast through room service and although the food quality was good, it took some time to receive our order. we had cocktails at the bar, one evening, but as it was empty, left to try other bars around the hotel, tried tap and went to the w hotel, much more happening and fun, definitely!had a tour of the wedding space at the four seasons, and felt like the meeting rooms were old, carpets and wall paper outdated. art work was extremely old and meaningless. we were not impressed with the space they had, especially after having seen new hotels in town, like the st. regis or the mansion.i am sure it was a very pretty hotel at some point. it is a very traditional hotel, nothing wrong with it, but outdated and not impressive.we had a great time regardless!i recently had the please of staying at the four season atlanta in midtown a hotel that claims to be a five star property and that bares the 5 star diamond award insignia on its wall using the accolade to convince customers that the hotel is what it truly isn‚äôt.for starters the hotels lacks the elegance and charm not to mention the 5 star qualities that put the four seasons hotel group on the map many years ago. the rooms are bland, out dated and fail to offer any of the modern amenities or special touches you would expect from a four season property. absent from the room are bathroom amenity kits and even slippers that must be requested from the concierge. the only amenity you will find in the room is an ironing board, iron, yellow pages and a green duck placed on your bed every night with a notice asking you if you want your sheets and towels to be changed as part of a green program. in all honesty this hotel felt more like a hampton inn then a four seasons especially after getting a wake up call from the hotels operator and being told it was free.if your are traveling to atlanta and looking for a luxury experience on par with other four seasons properties such as new york, paris, milan, and hong kong you will be very disappointed.personally, i am now starting to question the validity of the 5 star diamond award based on hotels that i have visited that are clearly not 5 star properties but exploit the shield as much as possible. i wonder if this award is given to hotels based on achievements or just for purchase if hotels meet certain requirements.the four season's as a group has grown tremendously through the years with some stellar properties but as a whole they have become complacent losing ground to chains such as mandarin oriental, peninsula and shangri-la who get it right more times then not!we stayed here for the weekend and it was nothing like i expected a 5 star hotel to be. we were not impressed at all!the rooms were ok, the beds were very comfortable.the bar in the lobby was fun, they had a very friendly guy playing the piano which we liked.we ordered room service one evening and it took them over an hour to bring up one order of chicken fingers!! we called after an hour to see what the hold up was and then they told us they were on the way up and then 20 minutes later they arrive! (i think they forgot our order orginally and then rushed it when we called to check on it)***my biggest and the most disgusting thing i noticed about the hotel was the saltwater pool.my sister & i went down to the pool to take a morning swim.... we get into the water, we walk toward the pool light and then start to notice all this hair, dirt & debris floating around in the pool. we both got grossed out and started walking toward the pool stairs to exit the pool on the way noticing more and more hair & dirt and stuff floating in the pool and then we see a bandaid!!!. disgusting!!!!!!!! for a 5 star hotel you would at least expect the have a clean pool to swim in! we hurried back to our room so we could get a shower.everything else was nice just don't go into the pool!!!!!!!!we booked a quick getaway to chill out during the holidays. arriving at 3pm on christmas, we found out the restaurant was closing after brunch, and not to reopen for several days. appetizers were available from the bar on the mezz, and through room service. there was nothing on the website warning visitors of the closure. there weren't even restaurant recommendations, or a listing of nearby restaurants offered!the same day, the pool and hot tub closed as well. again, no notification on the website.we booked this 5 star hotel to enjoy the luxury, the restaurant, the health club, the hot tub. if i knew all of these facilities were going to be unavailable, i would've saved this getaway for another weekend. the hotel's lack of information on the website about the seasonal closures, and the lack of service in assisting customers during the closures was shameful.the experience was so poor, i won't choose four seasons properties for any of my frequent travel. i'll return to more consistant properties (halekulani, grand wailea, mandarin oriental sfo...)note to hospitality professionals- it is better to be proactive and up-front about closures and standard service suspensions on your website and risk losing the reservation, rather than advising guests at check-in. a more proactive approach builds customer loyalty.booked as a luxury weekend stay - but very disappointed. sold as rooms renovated in 2018. room had not been touched for 20 yrs +. original room on 6th floor very noisy as overlooks hvac roof system - moved for the second night to a much better room booked for 4 people - towels in place for 2, 1 robe, no slippers (all of these despite asking for more at reception). in addition, went for pre-dinner drink in lumen bar and took 20 mins for drinks to arrive - despite not being particularly busy. they seem to have a bizarre system of waiting for 3-4 tables drinks orders to be ready before delivering the the table. special metion to the bell team who were all exceptionally friendly and helpfuloh what a mess, first they state that the rooms have been remodeled however not all floors have! apparently you have to request an updated room before hand. our room was supposed to be on the wellness floor, but wasn‚äôt. the front desk clerk was as friendly as a bump on a log. i travel a lot and stay at all types of hotels, this place is no better than a fairfield or holiday inn.wow. disappointed and can‚äôt wait to check out tomorrow. valet was super confusing when we got here and we were rushed inside, hoping we have a car tomorrow. arriving in the room and the carpet is soaked in various places, there are minor stains on the bedding, and the ‚äúpersonalized requests‚äù i made were not completed even after i was told they would be! we came back in to the room from our concert and the bathroom door was locked? had to call the front desk and it took someone 15 minutes to get up here and unlock it. now we are trying to utilize the late night ordering and the line has been busy for 20 mins. really? a $500 a night hotel can only have one line for ordering? wow.the atlanta ritz is sub par at best for a hotel that‚äôs portrayed at the top. the service is as expected, however the rooms are in need of update and repair. my room had stained carpets, soiled waste basket and severely worn furnishings. the quality of the room was beneath your typical hampton inn. don‚äôt splurge on the ritz in atlanta - save it for another location where you will get a room that actually matches the price tag.i am sitting in the hotel writing this. today is our 2nd night here, and tomorrow we are checking out.my husband and i travel a lot, and we've stayed at 4 to 5 star hotels worldwide. that said, i can confidently tell you that this should not be a 5-star hotel. the level of poor thought and care is visible everywhere. i will tell you what bothers me the most and compare it to hyatt centric new orleans (where appropriate), a 4-star hotel that we were at right before this:‚ä®‚ä®1) horrific internet. don't even think about streaming netflix, hulu, or anything. you won't even get the apps to open and load the homepage on your devices. i had to disable it and use my cellphone's data plan to get anything done. hyatt had amazing internet.‚ä®‚ä®2) the shower head is horrible. it sprays super wide with each stream of the spray very thin. it's very uncomfortable and does not give a good rinse. i had to stand up on the narrow ledges on the sides to get a decent shower as this gives me access to more concentrated spray that is only available close to the shower head. this is dangerous, i do not recommend that you do this. to give you an idea just how wide the water sprays: i opened my arms and made the biggest circle i can with my fingertips just barely touching. that's how wide the spray is when it makes contact with my body. now imagine if the spacing between each spray is wide and each spray is thin. yup. if you care about showers then don't stay here. hyatt had a very decent shower! it was a 4-star hotel so not super fancy but easily better than this.‚ä®‚ä®3) the hairdryer is so old. it looks like it's straight from the 1970s because i was born in the 1980s and the hairdryer i grew up with looked much more advanced than this. additionally, it‚äôs got some gross-looking green dust in the mesh. the worse part is that a few seconds into blowdrying my hair a fried ball of someone else's hair flew out and hit me in the face. yes, that happened. it is also a sign this dated hairdryer is quite unsafe - catching people's hair inside. hyatt had dashing drybar hairdryers (basically, a very good brand).‚ä®‚ä®4) the toilet paper is hanging from the most absurd position i've ever seen. it's located where people typically place plungers and toilet brushes - close to the ground on the back wall to the right of the toilet. now i'm pretty flexible, and it's really annoying for me to get the toilet paper while sitting on the toilet. i can easily see how this is not doable for many others. who designed this?‚ä®‚ä®5) there aren't many places to hang stuff in the bathroom. if you hang up a toiletries bag like i did then prepare to hang the bath towel inside the bathtub as you shower and use that damp towel when you are done. hyatt had plenty of places to hang stuff.‚ä®‚ä®6) the bathroom is small (standard king room) and the door opens inward, taking up the precious little place to stand. it's super awkward in there and uncomfortable. if you want to stand in there with another person then be prepared for a very tight squeeze. again, poorly designed. hyatt's bathroom was slightly bigger, and also more thoughtfully designed so we always felt comfortable standing in there, even with 2 people.‚ä®‚ä®7) while there are cotton pads etc. they are simply thrown into the same drawer as the old hairdryer and scattered inside. no cares given. hyatt packaged this nicely into a small, nice looking, labeled box.‚ä®‚ä®8) just one small bottle of water (smaller than a can of coke) available in the room for free. chris at the front desk was nice enough to give us 2 small bottles during check in but even then it is not enough to stay hydrated for a night. if you arrive late like we did then prepare to be thirsty or pay the super premium on the regular-sized bottle of water in the room... alternatively, you can take the small bottle/cups in the room and make multiple trips down the hall to get water from a dispenser, which may or may not always be filled with water. hyatt gave us 1 complimentary extra large bottle of water per night. ‚ä®‚ä®9) no slippers. hyatt didn't have slippers in the room either, but hey it was a 4 star so i'm not going to complain about that.‚ä®‚ä®10) in a room booked for 2 there is one robe available. why? hyatt had 2 robes.‚ä®‚ä®11) the bath towels are small and look / feel cheap. hyatt had bigger towels that felt newer and softer to the touch (higher quality).12) bathroom smelled like pee when we arrived ‚äî clearly not from us‚ä¶ hyatt‚äôs bathroom did not smell like pee.13) the sink in the bathroom is really high and shallow. so every time you brush your teeth and spit water in it know that it will splash back on you. hyatt had a nice, well-designed sink that gave us no issues.14) housekeeping replenished nothing. we were low on shower gel and lotion after the first night and came back to our room cleaned but neither replenished. hyatt made sure we never had to ask for any of these basic things ‚äî housekeeping was on top of it.15) housekeeping picked up hair from the shower and just threw it into the toilet. first of all, don‚äôt do that! hair can cause problems not only in pipes/plumbing but for the sewer system as well! take the hair, throw it in the trash, and take it with you! they also didn‚äôt flush it, which is unsightly, but i wasn‚äôt going to reach my hand in to pick it up so flushed it in the end :(16) we always participate in the reuse your towel program at hotels, but usually hotel housekeeping folds it for us anyway so when we come back from a long day things look tidy. the towels we hung up here are left were untouched when we came back. so ‚äî untidy bathroom in the morning = untidy bathroom in the evening if you choose to be green. not only did hyatt always made sure things look tidy when we returned, they also took time to organize all my little bottles of toiletries for me. when we came back from a day of exploring, hyatt‚äôs housekeeping gave us an impeccable space to rest.17) those little flies you see on the streets? they are in the hotel too. getting water from the dispenser? right there with you. getting food from the buffet? there too ‚äî especially the fruit section. we did not see a single bug at hyatt, even though anyone who‚äôs been to french quarter will tell you the streets aren‚äôt the cleanest. this means the hotel is actively maintaining a clean environment for guests.18) dirty ‚äúclean‚äù dishes with some dried food residue and molded fruit at breakfast buffet. the buffet itself is very, very basic. i don‚äôt mind that, but i do want clean dishes and fresh food‚ä¶19) okay, i‚äôm going to leave you with a good one - the desk lamp in our room turned on by itself in the middle of the night last night!!! how creepy is that??? my husband was already asleep, and i‚äôve turned off all the light but was still tossing and turning in the bed. it usually takes me about 30 minutes to fall asleep, and 15-20 minutes in the light on the desk just turned on! oh. my. god. i woke my husband up and made him go turn it off but then slept with my bedside lamp on for the rest of the night because it‚äôs seriously freaky. these lamps are really old and i‚äôm just going to assume it was janky but imagine being in the room by yourself and things just turn on by themselves in the the middle of the night. no thank you! i‚äôve never had this happen to me at any other hotel, ever!now these are other bads\" that i personally don't mind as much, but going to let you know because you might:‚ä®‚ä®1) dated room. hyatt's room were really new. ‚ä®2) \"city views\" can mean mostly the parking lot, and only some of the city.3) there are no source of white light in the room. for ladies thinking about putting makeup on you will not be able to see your makeup in true color. there is a vanity table but the light there is really dark, and also orange. hyatt had bright white light available.4) if you get the free breakfast package know that you cannot get hot breakfast before 6am. only cold menu items are available for room service before 6am (restaurants aren‚äôt open). they have an overnight menu with hot food that is available before 6am but your breakfast credits only applies to the breakfast menu, and only cold items on that menu before 6am.5) we got the ‚äúexplore atlanta‚äù package that comes with 2 free tickets to some attractions per night of stay. they gave us 2 kids tickets to coca cola world even though we specifically said we needed adult tickets. we didn‚äôt find out until we got there and we ended up buying tickets there and the hotel reimbursed us by counting that towards our room fees. so ultimately, it was a small hassle for us, and they made it right so it‚äôs okay. check your tickets when you get them so you don‚äôt end up having to deal with it like us.‚ä®‚ä®i know the hyatt i'm comparing it to isn't located in the same city but i just wanted to give you an idea of the experience we had at a 4-star hotel vs. this \"5-star\". like i said, we've stayed at so many 4 and 5 star hotels that it is a no brainer that this isn't up to 5-star standards no matter which hotel i compare it to and where... the only reason i am giving it 2 stars, vs. 1 is the fact the we had a pleasant check-in experience with chris. he was all smiles, friendly, patient, and helpful. other staffs we‚äôve encountered have been really good too.‚ä®‚ä®for the price we paid to stay at a 5-star hotel i'm truly, truly disappointed. i hope the hotel can start thinking for the guests and not just about making money. for example, you don't need to refurbish the room to replace those hairdryers‚ä¶ i can go on, but what does a 5-star experience mean to you? how should your guests feel? right now i'm feeling pretty bad. i wouldn‚äôt come back, and also wouldn‚äôt recommend this hotel to anyone else.\"i feel like this hotel doesn't go the extra mile for their platinum guests like other ritzs. we were very disappointed on check in when i asked for a complimentary suite upgrade for platinum members and were told that there was not one... not even an upgrade to a city view. i understand that upgrades are not always available; however, my husband literally checked online as i was standing there checking in and city view rooms as well as suites were available. i just don't appreciate being lied to by the front desk attendants. upgrades are a platinum perk... not something i'm just asking for out of the blue.additionally, other ritzs generally send some sort of platinum gift, such as fruit or cookies. i hate to complain, but i appreciate when hotels recognize brand loyalty. that's why you continue to stay at a specific brand... to get membership perks. as a side note, we actually spent the next night at the intercontinental in buckhead (where my husband is a member, but not the highest level), and we were given an upgrade.the newly renovated rooms (on certain floors only) are nice, and it was very quiet.purchased ritz experience for one night through a charity auction. the service was exactly what you expect from the ritz folks. i was disappointed that there wasn't a pool...they arranged for me to use a sister property. i had trouble there...they surprised me with a cappuccino and biscotti. the buffet breakfast was good...but not as good as omni atlanta. the room was quality. not modern...distinguished. except for in room coffee....loved sampling all of them. walking distance to underground, gwcc, mercedes stadium, martaspent one night at the ritz in atlanta and had a very mixed experience. i got a nice and newly renovated room, big, clean, well equipped, high floor, nice bed, very quiet and good sleep quality. i ordered room service for breakfast and even though took a bit too long to deliver just one omellette (around 35 minutes), it was good and well served.wifi is not very stable and speed of connection not the best.now the negatives: yesterday was my birthday. around 10:30am the same nice lady who delived my breakfast knocks on my door, with a plate with 3 cup-cackes, and a glass of champagne. she said it was an attention\" because of my birthday....that¬¥s all what i was told......hence i was very positively surprised and delighted with such a gesture from the hotel.....but.....the true story is that on that day, my wife called from london and told the hotel she wanted to send something to my room as a surprise for my birthdayshe had to call 3 times and spoke with a non-attentive guest relations person to work this out.she was asked to send a fax (....fax ???????.....who uses faxes today ????) with her credit card details for the hotel to charge whatever was going to be sent to my room. jessica from guest relations confirmed that they don¬¥t accept e-mails with pdf files for this.because i was checking out on that morning, my wife and my son called a few times to the hotel to be sure that what they paid for, was delivered to my room on time......it was delivered just 5 minutes before i left (10:40 aprox)......despite my wife and son trying to arrange this since 7amsomehow, the hotel had a unique skill to complicate something very simple and was very good to show a complete lack of common sense and proactivitybut the worst of this, is that the cupcakes i received in my room were sent by my wife and son and not the hotel, but the hotel didn¬¥t have the delicacy to let me know or put a small card of even piece of paper with a note that this was coming from my family. bottom line, hotel took credit for something they didn¬¥t do......very bizarre. this shows a complete lack of attention to detail and that guest relations team needs urgent training.it is not about money, is purely conceptual, but hotel should refund the card used to pay for this, simply because they did it completely wrong. let¬¥s see if they smart to acknowledge how bad they were on this and this time have a gesture. lot¬¥s to learn for the ritz carlton team in atlanta.......\"staying at the property now... certainly not the ritz cartlon quality i would except. our room is very dated, from the old gold carpeting to the popcorn ceilings, old school tub and shower.... couple that with the rap music coming from the adjoining room and this lifetime platinum member won‚äôt be coming back.stayed 2 nights for my anniversary. couple of reasons for my low rating. not a good checkin experience. as a platinum member was told that i could upgrade to executive suite for $100 per might on the phone before i arrived. front desk refused to honor that. i was pretty upset as i was hoping to surprise my wife.the property seems very dated with carpet stains etc in the room. the location of atl ritz is close to the sports facility but a pretty rough area. if you walk one block south you will run into a lot of interesting characters. not an area you want to take a stroll around.in town for a porsche club event and stayed at this hotel. arrival was smooth and i was upgraded to a suite which was appreciated. we departed for an event with the club, stopping only to fill my car up with gas. drove a total of 9 miles that day returning to the hotel with a full tank of gas when entrusting it to the valet. valet gave us a claim ticket and we retired to our room for the evening. the following day i called valet to request my car as we would be leaving for home. we arrived at the valet about 15 minutes later and the car was no where to be found. we waited an additional 15-20 minutes while they located\" it. it finally arrived and we left. i glanced at my gas gauge as i got on the highway and was surprised to see i had much less gas than i had left the car with. i was annoyed but headed home nonetheless. i then noticed my headlights didn't work and the air conditioning was not going on either. i arrived home and the key would not budge from the ignition. i proceeded to walk around the exterior of the car and the car had also been scratched. it was apparent that valet caused some pretty extensive damage to care while it was in the care of the hotel. i called the ritz that evening and spoke to the assistant manager mr. fitz who assured me this matter would be discussed with the property manager mr. wali. no one ever called. no one ever responded to my letter. no one at this hotel cared. i travel extensively and this was truly a disappointment to say the least. the damage was extensive and costly and no one could even pick up the phone to speak with me. if i were looking for a hotel in atlanta do yourself a favor and stay at the four seasons, in the long run it will cost you much less.\"i knew something was off upon check in when there were guests complaining. i‚äôve been a loyal customer having stayed at numerous ritz properties throughout the years on both business and pleasure. this property is severely lacking on service and quality. rooms are outdated and service is actually bad. would have been better off at the courtyard marriott.if you have ever stayed in a ritz this will be a surprise. dirty old rooms, with poor and rude staff.rc pride themselves on customer service and a pre shift huddle. well atlanta 181 has lost the values of a great hotel chain.stay if you want...just don‚äôt expect the rc sizzleh the location is great if you have downtown business. if not traffic will kill you.second, staff is good.until you explain at 9 am that people are banging hammers on top of you for two hours and they say thank you for your feedback.be careful staying here and ask the basic questions.to top it off room service menu is basic. when i tried ordering from atlanta grille it was as if nobody on the planet did that. five transfers later i got a lame steak and a great soup.long story short, no rooms downtown atl so you will get screwed one way or another.good luckwe had a 4 night stay here in december, on floor 15.the good: great location downtown, convenient and walkable. we had a cool city view. the lobby is nicely decorated, and most staff were very pleasant, especially front desk and bell staff.the bad: the room furnishings are very worn and dated. our linens had holes in them, the soft fixtures were stained, carpet also had a large hole in it. i received a very nice call from housekeeping after a survey, and they informed me the hotel was soon to be upgraded. when that's complete, i would recommend it fully.worst ritz carlton experience at this location as far as service goes. stayed in a suite for 4 nights. don‚äôt expect to be impressed at the atlanta location. very, very slow service at ag, long wait for valet and bell hop service did not answer the phone. left room at 9 am and came back at 3pm and room still not made up. never received two housekeeping visits per day as advertised. no attention to detail. good location for downtown. many better options in atlanta!!the walls a super thin, the rooms need updating and do not valet if you don‚äôt have an extra hour to wait for your car!!! terrible valet experience that is still being addressed with management. the only pleasant experience was the front desk at check in and have an easy access charging station next to the bed, though that was overshadowed by the disgusting bedside lamp. not worth the money or what i would consider reflects the ritz carlton name.there is nothing strikingly wrong with this hotel - if it were a marriott i would give it 4 stars. but, when you pay for a ritz you expect a ritz... and this is not a ritz.the check-in process was ok. nothing like the ritz‚äôs i have been to across the country and caribbean.the room is meh. dated. maybe a 3/5 in quality and cleanliness. there was a bathroom hook missing on the door - and just the hardware showing. the cashews in the honor bar had been half eaten and placed back in the bar. the room was dusty around lights, tops of mirrors, etc.also, upon checkout, we were very rudely told to bring our ticket downstairs because they were too busy. no one offered to help with luggage, etc.again... not terrible. just not the ritz.this ritz destoryed my image of the ritz. to the point i had 3 other nights planned out and booked that i cancelled my future bookings.upon check-in everything was great friendly staff even offered glass of champaine. lobby was full of free candy and everything had a great feel. i could not wait to enjoy the great sleep for this weekend getaway. i also had a late checkout planning to sleep in. room was comfortable bed felt great then around 7am we were awoke to the sounds of scraping walls in the room nextdoor. sounded like someoone was trying to scratch through our wall. we could not sleep as the aound did not stop we got out of bed 730 to get breakfast hoping to come back to quiet. nope returned to the room around 830 low and behold still scraping!!! are you kidding me!! why would you put someone in a room next to a planned renovation? that entire floor plus the floor above and below should have been blocked while doing renovation but they actually booked the room next door what a joke! since the renovation was still going on and the crew looked like they would be there a while as they had the next door room propped open around 9:00 we started packing up and departed the hotel around 9:30 to banging and scraping sounds. threw away that great night sleep and the late check out we had. never again! that was an awful error on this hotel to book a room connecting to a planned renovation room. to top it off upon my early checkout nobody even asked how was my stay. or you have a late checkout what's driving you to depart so early? complete disappointment from the ritz!first the staff is really nice and has provided an excellent service. the room is clean despite a big black hair on the sink when we arrive.but the room is so disappointing! it is not on par with the ritz carlton name. it has not been updated for decades. there is only one robe per room. not enough water to make coffee.it is very dated and not luxurious . we had better rooms in standard hotel.our room was number 1809.i arrived yesterday evening at 6.30pm booked via amex fine hotel & resortsfrom arriving i took all my luggage 3 bags including golf clubs out of taxi as the young guys were all watching something on a mobile phone before i interrupted them !reception waited for 5 minutes before been seen to - the young lady welcomed me and then gave me my key to room 2503 and said i have a $60 voucher included in my room rate - end of !!didn't tell me about hotel what time breakfast was nothing !i asked had i been upgraded as per the programme - she replied yes club room but you cannot use the club facilities !i explained that i was gold with marriot didn't matter totally dismissed me.then got to my room very tired and bed linen pictures here were torn and well worn.i missed breakfast but can only comment on lunch - tom from serbia welcomed me and was the only member of staff that actually looked like he was working !!finally on leaving today two young bell boys now not on phones wanted to be my best friend in case i was to tip which clearly i did not.not a 5 star hotel disappointing will not be back and shall be letting amex fine hotels & resort programme know as well.we planned to stay at the ritz carlton for two nights to kick off a week-long trip in the south that started with a visit to the georgia aquarium. unfortunately, our friday flight was cancelled and we ended up driving all night to still make our 10:30am tour. the ritz staff was incredibly accommodating. david at the front desk found a room for us to freshen up in after the long drive. tom ensured our daughter felt like a princess every time she walked through the door. after a very full day at the aquarium she returned to balloons, cupcakes, and a birthday card. they really worked hard to make the inconvenience of driving 9.5 hrs to get there melt away. as a friend said to me afterwards, ‚äòthat is why you always stay at the ritz.‚äôwe were in town for a wedding. the hotel is located downtown\" which seems to be code for in the middle of an area you don't really want to walk around. it's pretty grim.the hotel is a bit old school. the rooms have a bit of an eighties feel to them. but they are large and well looked after. though i think they gave us a corner room which is naturally larger.they did lose a piece of my suit in dry cleaning. but found it eventually. kind of a mess. but people were really trying and i've got to credit that.\"i have stayed in many ritz carlton hotels all over the us and throughout the world over the last 30 years and this one is in such bad shape that i'm surprised it still carries the ritz carlton name.stained carpets and bedspread, peeling paint, rusty hinges, shower bar coming off the wall, threadbare drapes, etc., etc., etc.i stayed here over 20 years ago and although the rooms are small, the condition was worthy of the ritz name. not anymore.downtown atlanta is not the greatest place, but if you are here for business or an event, the ritz is a high quality option. this was a good spot, but nothing truly memorable at this location. nothing wrong, nothing terribly exciting...i have to give an incredible shout out to ms. tammy w. and ms. anita k. at the front desk of the ritz carlton, atlanta. after this crazy bridge collapse this evening, i was forced to change my reservation from a perimeter starwood property to a marriott property downtown (ritz carlton). only problem, no glasses in the car in traffic and booked for tomorrow. needles to say, when i showed up, you got it, not one single room. tammy and anita went right to work trying to get me a room in town. we finally found one close by, but what so impressed me was the commitment they showed to take care of me, my luggage, my car, and etc... some folks in hospitality don't get it\". these two do in a way that the ritz better be paying attention to. these classy ladies will get snatched up with their level of service and compassion. thank you tammy and anita. you kept your word and i really appreciate it. dr. jim barrett\"my fiance and i booked a one night stay at the ritz carlton to celebrate our birthdays but were thoroughly disappointed with our stay. when we first arrived, no one from valet came to our car until we were already out the car approaching the valet stand. no one helped us with our bags or anything. we were not greeted upon entering the hotel, but everyone around us was greeted and asked if they need anything. the staff member at the elevator was busy on his cellphone and did not even offer us any help when we couldn't figure out how to work the elevator. our room was clean but very dated. not what i would have expected a ritz carlton to look like. there is no refrigerator. when i booked the room online, it stated the room had a city view\" but our view was of a tall office building across the street. when we went to valet to get our car to go to dinner, the staff was very dismissive. the american breakfast was good. overall, i would not stay at this hotel again, the staff made us feel as if we were invisible. i will go right around the corner to the westin, where the service is 100 times better.\"very clean hotel and friendly staff. on saturday between 4-6 there is an artist who comes and draws caricatures for guest.i had a king deluxe room which was very spacious. the room has every amenity except a refrigerator. if you have medicine or food there is no way to refrigerate it.only complaint... as soon as i put my bags down, around 6pm, and take my clothes off to get in the shower my door is opened. luckily, i had my latch on my door. it was loss prevention. i refused to take the latch off and explained i was in the room was there a problem. they stated no and left. once i left the room, upon my return i discovered housekeeping had came back into my room. i am not sure what all of that was about and no one bothered to explain.first and foremost, the service and attention by the staff is bar none. i have been staying at this location (5 days a week) for a couple of months during the week and it amazes me that my comments and observations (negative or otherwise) is closely scrutinized to make sure that my stay goes smoothly.yes, the location is downtown. security is closely monitored. they are around but not noticed. i have left things in the room and asked for them the following week and they are returned with no issues.amenities in regular room include umbrella, robe, shoe horn, and nespresso coffee machine. bottled water is available in room, gym, and driveway.the gym is well equipped but is very tight. the men's room has showers, sauna, and steam shower. (i suspect the women's bathroom has the same amenities but can't verify that <g>)i am looking forward to the renovations to the property this summer.when i checked into the hotel the staff was friendly, i made sure to confirm the deluxe suit which i had purchased. when i went to my room i found it to be extremely small, not only was the size concerning but the walls were a very bad yellow, like bright golden yellow. the floor was dirty in the room itself and the shower walls had hair in two different spots! i would like to point out the staff is very friendly and they did accommodate our late check out needs. i will not recommend this hotel for anyone staying downtown and we will not be returning!i was up in atlanta for a business trip with my husband and 2 month old daughter. the room was very dated and the crib was super dated... the crib had paint chips missing all over the railings. while i was there the maid/turn down service went thru my belongings and took my credit card and used it till i froze it. corporate did communicate with us and comp two nights in the future but still was not a pleasant stay. the best part of my stay i would say is when they gave my daughter a ty plush toy which she still sleeps with today.we love the location for sports events and other downtown sites and activities. the bar scene in the lounge can be crowded. the service in the hotel is great. we upgraded to an executive suite and were disappointed in the bathroom, only one sink. we could use the extra bath room though, but still for that price a double vanity sink is in order. the pet fee ($150) is outrageous.i just finished a quick one night stay here and would definitely not return. the hotel is 4 stars at best and my room was filthy and worn. the knobs behind the sink looked like they had not been cleaned in months, caked with green and black soap scum and toothpaste residue ‚äì there was even an old toothpaste cap wedged between the mirror and sink ‚äì gross!!!other highlights included a shattered wall sconce and the bedside lamp had some kind of sticky residue all over it ‚äì mega gross!carpets are stained and every seem is torn, making for large gaps.at least the staff was friendly. there are too many other newer, cheaper hotels in the area to consider returning here.wanted to love our one night stay but when we found a pair of soiled ladies undies in the pocket of their iconic symbol of luxury, the ritz carlton robe, our hopes were crushed. even worse the robe had been staged by the maid service as if freshly placed for our stay. (how could we be sure the sheets were changed or the bathroom freshly cleaned?) when assured by the manager that clean, fresh robes were placed in rooms for each new guest we had to assure him they were not. we also, unfortunately, stayed the same night that two professional sports teams were staying. management chose to shut down all elevators to accomodate the teams by preventing their fans from accessing their rooms. this management did without notifying the other guests which caused delays for many guests staying for a wedding, including the wedding party. guests waiting for elevators finally called the desk and a clerk came and escorted them via elevator, then shut the elevator down again with a key until the next call from delayed guests. not only was this a terrible inconvenience and poor service for many guests but also a safety issue. shame on this giant of the industry. that said, we were very impressed and appreciative with the efficient, helpful and friendly service by the valets and bellmen.this is my 2nd stay at this hotel within 6 months and i came back because they offer first class service. the bellman, valet and front desk staff assist in making your stay the best and try in every way to make you feel comfortable since you are away from home. then of course it's either that one thing or one person that can take a 5 rating and turn it into 1 rating. on sunday 9-11 we were sitting in the lobby enjoying coffee before we went back to our room when my husband decided to go upstairs to go to the bathroom he was followed by a security guard. my husband was talking to me while on the steps and the guy just kept staring at him as if he was doing something wrong and then when my husband went up the steps the guy followed him to and from the bathroom. i proceeded upstairs and i see him following him back from the bathroom. now i know most readers and even the hotel will say how do you know that he was following him. well here's the kicker. i stopped at the ag restaurant got a menu and as we were reading the menu the guy stops at the hostess stand to engage in conversation with the hostess while still trying to keep an eye on my husband. then as we proceeded downstairs he followed. if there was a problem or if he had concerns that we he was a young black guy with an ice cube shirt and if he felt as though he wasn't a guest at the hotel then address the issue don't follow him as if he was a criminal. we paid our money to stay there and to have a good time not to feel uncomfortable. oh but wait had he publicly made it noticeable that he was harassing a black guy at the ritz carlton it may have created controversy leading up to a lawsuit. so instead why don't i follow him and maybe no one will notice. well i noticed and it pissed me off to know and i strongly feel that race played a part in what took place.nice hotel rooms are ok if a hair dated. but the staff and service are second to none. the front desk, valet, bell and housekeeping personnel could not have been nicer and more genuine. i would not stay anywhere else in downtown atlanta.our final destination was the ritz carlton amelia island. we stayed one night in atlanta. we were traveling with a 4 yr. old, 7yr. old, 9 yr. old and a 11 yr. old.we had driven for 16.5 hours.we had two rooms, both the same size, but one on club level.in one room, (club level) there was hairs (not ours) and plain filth on the floor. room service was called, and cleaned the bath tub, completely skipping the hair. they were called again, (and with direction) finally cleaned the needed spot.the in-room dining menu was completely fallen apart.you would expect a nicer quality stay for how much money you are spending.we booked two rooms, one with one king bed, and one with two que en beds.when we got to the hotel we were told by check-in staff that our rooms would be on different floors (6 and 21, and we are a family -ridiculous) but we would still have the rooms we booked. we were offered one suite for all five of us, which is also ridiculous because the suit only has one king bed and a sofa bed. we obviously declined the offer,\" as they call it.when we got to our rooms, both of them were king bed rooms, not what we booked. we called the front desk and they said that the check-in staff had told us that no queen rooms were available, which is simply not true. we were once again offered the suite but that's just ridiculous.honestly, you're better off going to a hyatt or holiday inn were you'll pay half for a room that's just as good and the staff respect the customer.\"our timing was definitely bad on this stay as there was some sort of foot race the next day, but we should have been warned at the time we called to make the reservation - not once we got there and checked in. the race and band started at 5 am - not what you want to hear when you got in at 230a. then we got a paper under our door stating the roads were fully closed - as in you could not leave - until 930 and even then there would only be partial access. needless to say - it was not a pleasant/restful visit. with all that aside - the view of the city was gorgeous, staff (other than not very informative) was friendly and accommodations as expected. would stay again - but recommend to ask about events in the area.i have been a merial rewards member for 10 years. i stay at marriots every month at least 3-10 days for busines. i have never been to a ritz carlton before so for this valentines weekend i wanted to surprise my wife and family at a prestigious hotel such as this. i type this as i am sitting i my room at the ritz.here is my review:as i pulled up to the hotel, there is a 10-15 minute wait from the street to pull into the marriot valet. they had only 2-4 people working valet. it took another 5 minutes for the valet to come to my car as i pulled up. early that day i called ahead of time to get a refrigerator in my room ready for us so we can put some groceries and milk for the kids. as i checked in our check in person named rachel confirmed that the refrigerator was ready for us in the room. to my surprise as we enter our room there is no refrigerator waiting for us. the only refrigerator is the bar refrigerator with alcohol in which does not do me any good for my groceries. i then try to connect to the internet as i always do with my name and room number and that does not work. they sent an engineer up and he gives me a passcode to use since it didn't work the traditional way..they have 5 elevators and to my surprise it takes 5-10 minutes for elevators to come to my floor. i am only on the 5th floor.i tell the manager on duty my issues and she asks me how she can make it better and she offers me 5000 points which does not get any free stays at the lowest marriot hotel. i would not recommend this hotel at all.their is a westin across the street that looks amazing and a residence inn a block away in which i may try or not..very disappointed in the service here.absolutely loved the ritz carlton in downtown atlanta! the staff was amazing everyone always had a smile on their face and more than willing to help you with anything!! can't wait to come back!!! food was fantastic!!!! i would highly recommend it to anyone.this may not be the newest and spiffiest ritza carlton, it is a very traditional downtown five star hotel that has a few worn spots---but the location is convenient to everything in atlanta. we were there for a group weekend event and the staff could not have been more accommodating.i came here on personal travel, very disappointed. it's a very pretentious hotel, and not all that cheap. but they charge you for high speed, and slow speed internet (hiding the charges). they charge you to use the business center, and charge you to use the printer.the sinks are fancy\" but the right the faucet is above the bowl means you can barely fit your hands between the two, good luck getting a cup under, and forget a water bottle. the toilet paper roll was mounted, literally, two inches above the floor, and well behind the toilet.sure the hotel is clean with a nice bed but the details of the hotel, and the way they try to get every nickel and dime out of you were very disappointing. next time i come to atlanta look for me in a hampton inn or residence inn. maybe i am not cultured enough for this hotel. if you stay here you will enjoy the room, but watch out for your wallet, and don't twist your back getting the toilet paper....\"i've stayed at this hotel many times for business. always great service, and right off the marta. every time i stay at this hotel, i am frustrated by the in room coffee maker. it's confusing, and makes a terrible cup of coffee. but that is really my only complaint, and i'm posting here because all of my colleagues have the same complaint. it might be time to go back to something less elegant looking that actually works.i was disappointed with the facilities. the staff were great and very friendly, but checked out within 12 hours to move across the street to the westin.i don't believe this hotel justifies the rate. i would be prepared to pay around the $129 level max. i had the following issues1) room old and tired needs refurbishment2) safe with a key (keys are so last century) and far too small to fit my macbook air, ipad. all i could fit in was my passport and then i had to carry a key around with me worrying i'd lose it.3) bathroom, not much better than a $50 motel. fancy looking toiletries don't improve a 70's bathroom.4) room so old it had one of those 80s style command modules. last time i saw one of those was a few years ago at the intercontinental in wellington.having said this the bed was comfortable, but i didn't stay long enough to unpack my bag or sample any of the hotels restaurants or amenities.i shan't be returning.you know that five star service you expect from the ritz? the staff calling you by name, anticipating your needs, and making your stay so enjoyable? this property offers none of that. valet is a disaster. everything else was very average.i'd recommend the jw in buckhead if you want that special attention.i am a native of atlanta and have stayed at this hotel several times in the recent past 5 years. i can give them credit for consistently moving in the same direction though - down. i stayed there recently for a weekend with my wife and it has even gone down another notch. i actually told my wife we should have stayed at the marriott marquis or the westin across the street, because at least the bar stayed open past 11pm. on both friday and saturday they shut the bar down regardless of the amount of people at the actually bar. we were there with some other couples so we were trying to have some drinks and food to chat and catch up for a while. the bar staff - including the bar manager told us to order room service if we wanted food or snacks.then they said we had to go to our actual room and order it and then bring it back down to the lobby if we wanted a snack or drinks past 11pm. we were so astonished that we did not even know what to say and left the hotel and went to another bar across the street.the valet seem to have their act together, but the rest is a complete joke. the room was fine, but nothing special except for the bed, which was indeed heavenly! the water pressure was weak at best and on sunday the hot water was out for like 2 hours - what???on sunday, in the breakfast area the manager seemed annoyed with the amount of people wanting to eat there and actually reprimanded my wife for asking why there were so many empty seats and so many people waiting.no apology, either. not impressed overall for the money we spent and would either stay at the buckhead location or any other hotel in the downtown area. stay at the buckhead ritz for a definite ritz\" experience.\"this is one of the weaker ritz properties, but of course it's still very nice, and it's not inordinately expensive. the whole place is worn, as others have noted, though the lobby is beautiful. the rooms are more like 4.5 stars. what is not great is the service. laundry, for example, was a debacle. the restaurant isn't very good, either. the gym is too small and crowded. i stayed on the club level. it, too, is good but not great. the manager himself is a fantastic guy, but it seems like they are on a budget. breakfast was not particularly good, with cold overcooked eggs three mornings in a row.we stayed at the ritz carlton may 2014 as a group. the staff and valet were exceptional but the hotel's style was very classical (dated in my opinion) and boring. we were coming off a stay at a four seasons that was exceptional so that is why we would not rate this higher but my rating is 3.5. we also prefer midtown compared to the location in downtown where this hotel is located.spent one night at this hotel, which was the headquarters for a conference. a very nice hotel. a bit pricey, but quite upscale. my only complaint is that it is hard to find at night. the signage was not illuminated, and was practically invisible at night. couple that with the legendary atlanta traffic and you have a potentially dangerous problem.arrived mid-afternoon on saturday with plans to attend billy joel concert. the staff was exactly what you would expect from a luxury hotel. the attention provided by the valet attendants, bellmen, front desk agents and room service attendants made our experience nothing short of perfect.decided to spend a weekend in atlanta with my wife after i worked in the city and stayed out at buckhead in the marriott there. i decided to switch to the city and the ritz for a little bit more style and comfort but i should probably have gone to the courtyard across the street or stayed in buckhead.this isn't a ritz-carlton and the website is an outright lie. according to the website there are 'magnificent marble baths' in the 'deluxe' rooms. the reality is about as far from that lie as is possible to get. the rooms are pretty much standard marriott fare, maybe a slightly better desk but the seats, chairs and carpets remind me of an unrefurbished hotel in cleveland that i stay at occasionally. the bath is tiny, the 'marble' refers to some pretty low quality tiles on the floor and the walls.the room itself had a vague mildew smell to add to that decaying without grandeur theme. i complained about the lie on the website and asked to move to a room which matched what they say they have, but apparently none of the deluxe rooms have anything other than the pathetic bathroom in our room. the manager i spoke with did offer another room, which was basically slightly bigger but with the same woeful bathroom and i declined as it was a pointless move. she then apologized and said 'i'll see what i can do'. the following day at 5pm i phoned to find out what had happened with that promise and was told they'd phone me back shortly with an update.this didn't happen... 3 and a half-hours later a voice-mail was left on the phone.its a complete travesty that this hotel gets to carry the ritz-carlton brand that graces hotels such as the miami south beach, battery park, grand cayman, laguna beach and dove mountain where i've stayed in the last few years. its not a luxury hotel and the dealing with my complaint was perfunctory at best.this is not a ritz carlton, stay here only if its cheaper than the marriott down the road.i stayed at the ritz downtown atlanta over the weekend. they overcharged my card so many times i had to deal with the front desk over and over. there was never an apology only excuses. when i got home there were more charges. i called back and spoke to the finance department. she couldn't even figure out what they had done. she was going to do a credit and make sure all was removed. this morning there was an additional charge and no credits. the extra amount was over $400.00. that just covers the money aspect of the trip. every time i made a request i was told they weren't sure they could do it and was given an excuse why.my husband and i travel extensively and i have never had to deal with this before. there are other reviews about the charge thing from other customers. thank goodness i was on the look out. i will never stay there again. this hotel was very nice at one time, not anymore...the only bright side was the room attendant. she was friendly and very helpful...i decided to stay at the ritz carlton this past weekend. i've always heard the name, which in my mind indicated luxury( which should luxury service, luxury room, location and so forth). i was extremely disappointed about the way the situation was handled in regards to my bill. there was an amount put on hold on my card once i checked in saturday evening(which i understood to be normal), however, once i checked out the next morning, i checked my bank account transactions, and there was an additional charge pending of $172.84. this was unfortunate because the bank system put the funds on hold, in addition to the first transaction (which was over $250). this may seem trivial to people that have large amounts of money to spend, but my personal financial situation is difficult and coming to this hotel was a stretch for me.i immediately contacted the hotel and asked for an explanation, which the one provided didn't make any sense whatsoever. i basically had to play phone tag between the hotel and the bank. now i have to wait an additional 24 hours to have the funds released back into my account. on a positive note, the valet staff and several of the front desk staff were very nice. other than that, i won't visit this particular hotel again.the only positive were the men who greet you upon arrival. on our first morning i am positive room service took their phone off the hook. front desk could not even reach them. front desk took our order and then called back to recommend we go to restaurant as room service would be an hour. after waiting 25 minutes to be seated we just left with no breakfast. called room service for supper and we waited an hour, tried to call and again busy signal continual. had to finally call a manager.ritz corporation needs to step in at this property. regardless of how full the hotel is or special events, you pay for the ritz to be better.i suggest you consider another hotel, too many problems here in service which is why one picks the ritz.people, this place is not worth it.why do you pay extra bucks for your hotel?1. reliable service2. clean accomodation3. good customer service4. place to relaxseems like they don't have these in their premises...very disappointed with this one...normally most other ritz carlton do have above 1-4... but once again this one do not..let me just say this the hotel was beyond beautiful our suite was beyond amazing everything you could ask for. what was wrong? the service the checkout service was horrid. we asked the hotel when we checked in to put a block on one of our rooms so their would be no room service charges anything like that. i called everyday the front desk everyday making sure there would be no charges they said there wasn't. we checkout, bam $245.87 worth of charges. the manger was rude, and said just tell your guest next time not to charge anything. how was that my fault when we asked for no charges on that room. we have never had a problem with a request like that before. he was rude, and kept going on about then decided he wanted to add a smoking fee cuz i had candles from another trip in my room saying we were trying to cover up the smoke smell. well that did get waved and all. but the fact is they should have should have called our room asking if these charges were okay.the ritz downtown atlanta was horrible compared with the ritz battery park, new york! i paid $700 for a $60 room. at best i would give it 2 stars. the room was very tiny, dusty and dirty, overlooking the top of the subway station. the bathroom was tiny and dirty and equal to a renovated motel 6 bathroom not a luxury hotel bathroom. the club lounge was no better than the holiday inn express buffet. i was actually wondering if i was at the right hotel. this hotel should not carry the ritz carlton name unless this is what the ritz carlton has become.picked the ritz for an upscale experience. the thing lacking was the room service. just could not get items refreshed. i'm surprised we had to keep asking. especially for the price we paid. otherwise, stay was good. pretty average experience for a the ritz. definitely not a cut above. rooms are definitely small. not my usual southern experience which is why i got on here.spent a weekend in the ritz with our two boys (4 and 6). we purchased the aquarium package which is an absolutely fantastic deal. the aquarium is an easy ten minute walk from the hotel through centennial park. get to the hotel early so you can grab your tickets and be first to the aquarium. (it is extremely crowded on the weekends.) rooms are comfortable, but nothing special. there is no pool at the ritz -- bad for kids -- but you are allowed to use the marriott marquis pool which is large and only three blocks away. there are plenty of kid-friendly restaurants within walking distance. we enjoyed the hard rock and meehan's, both having good kids menus and having enough chaos to keep the kids entertained. again, each are less than a block from the hotel. we had breakfast in the atlanta grill which was part of the package. the grill has great food but the service is remarkably slow if you order off of the menu -- very bad for kids. save yourself some pain and go with the buffet. request a high floor (22 or higher) so when you leave in the morning you can catch the elevator empty on the way down. there are long waits for an empty spot as people departing for the day fill the elevators. have fun!my first stay was veterans day weekend (november 2013).con: i woke up with bug bites on my arm, neck and hands and had to be moved to a new room. the ipod dock in the new room didnt work and the bathrobe was stained...... it took more than 10 hours to have both replaced. the hotel gave me a complimentary fruit plate a bottle of fiji water and comped 1 night of my weekend stay. they also mailed me a 1 free night voucher to return for a 2nd try\". very disappointing!!!!!pro: valet and front desk staff were extremely courteous.\"my husband and i were researching hot spots for our date night and ran across the lobby lounge\" at the ritz carlton. we thought this would be an excellent place to have a memorable experience and felt we were worth the money! so, we hopped into our corvette and headed out to the ritz carlton in atlanta georgia. when we arrived, the valet parking agent was missing and no where to be found. we brushed this off and chocked it up to a very busy saturday night. then we began our quest to find a parking space that would fit the corvette and also be safe. two levels down in the garage, we finally found a place. we were excited to be able to get in, enjoy music and eat great food. once in, we determined that the lobby lounge was just that, music in the lobby! :( no fear, so we headed to a host, who made us wait until she was finished with her personal conversation with a waiter, laughing and wispering while we waited nearby, unhelped. finally, she approached us and recommended that we seat ourselves in one of the lounge chairs in the lobby and wait for a wait staffer to help us. long story short, two awful salads later (filled with mostly brine lettuce), we were displeased with the meal (spaghetti which had a very nasty pink sauce in it, and classic cesar salad with a very fishy aftertaste) but still tried to make the most of the situation. the waiter removed one salad. but replaced it with a $22 charge of single glass champagne (which i did not order)! the band was alright (the waiter aid they were the best band the lobby ever had) and the bill was $127 (1 salad, 1 cheese plate and 1 beer) and it as the worse experience ever!! we paid $9 for the parking and my husbands corvette was scratch on the side when we left.do not go to the ritz carlton atlanta - you will be very disappointed!!\"upon arriving to the hotel we were greeted with a very nice associate at the front desk. the concierge was also very helpful and friendly. other than that...horrible!!! our room was tiny and not as nice as a courtyard marriott!!! housekeeping and security seemed to be having a party outside of our room morning, noon and night! they were so loud and obnoxious! the hotel needs a massive update and is really looking old, dated and worn out! i could not believe that ritz carlton would attach their amazing quality and service to this horrible property!!!the best part of the hotel was the excellent service. every employee i spoke with went out of their way to be helpful. the room itself was clean, well decorated and quiet. it was a little on the small side but i was not surprised based on this hotel being downtown. most importantly, the bed was extremely comfortable. room service was prompt but the food was just average. internet access was very fast and reliable. the 24 hour fitness center was a little small but well maintained and had the basic cardio equipment and weights. the breakfast buffet was very good.the only downside of my experience (and unfortunately my last impression of the hotel) was that the parking garage next to the hotel i was referred to for self parking, charged significantly more than their advertised rate. i was told that many guests have complained about this but ultimately everyone pays the extra cost so they can exit the garage. i realize the hotel may not be involved in this scam, but they should not refer guests to such a dishonest operation.i was bitten by a spider. woke up with a huge, swollen, target-like (telltale of a spider bite) on my elbow and my face and arm were puffy. called the front desk and the manager came up with loss prevention. two days later i get an email from corporate asking if i'm okay and that guess what...it's not their fault. their extermination and cleaning records show they're not liable\". awesome. yet i have this festering bite on my arm, clearly i brought the spider in myself or was bitten somewhere else (according to them). doesn't matter that i came straight from the airport at midnight, did not check a bag and was wearing a tank top, long sleeved button down and heavy sweater coat...yeah i clearly was bitten before i arrived, damn spiders got under everything without me feeling a thing.really, inexcusably, horrible service. did i mention i'm a platinum member. so long marriott, back to starwood or hyatt.\"i recently stayed at the ritz downtown (first time in 25 years of visiting atl) during an airport layover. it's not bad in any way but does not have any particular character or charm. it feels more like a high-end marriott and the rooms could use a refresh.but the price on weekends is very low ($150) and when booked through amex fhr it becomes practically free--reservations include $100 food/beverage credit, and complimentary breakfast. so it's a great deal!but if you're in town for fun, stay at the buckhead location instead.well located with a fast check in. the decor is missing the mark and is not ritz carlton luxe.room was small and bathroom is claustrophobic with an impractical sink. asprey amenities were nice. room was a bit tired and in need of a refresh. room service was fast and accurate.the breakfast was well presented and hot!the lobby bar was nice but the ambiance was strange as far as ambiance.skip the restaurant very disappointing. poor presentation and taste, average service.stayed here for a night after delta stranded me in the city. received upgrade to club level, complimentary food & bev credit.the outside of the building is pretty ugly, and the rooms are rather small and showing their age. the restaurant/bar is solid, nothing amazing. but the top-notch service all-around makes up for it.reliable hotel, just don't expect anything out-of-this-world amazing. if i was spending big bucks, i'd stay at buckhead. (is that why they call it buckhead? dunno not from around here)i have been to days inns that were better. they charged us over $300. a night. it was hardly worth it. we were promised a room with a perfect view of the 4th fireworks from our window on the 24t floor- executive suites. the exec lounge was nice, friendly staff (especially walter), good snacks. the room did not get a view of the fireworks at all, that was the only reason we were there. being partially handicapped kept me from being down on the street, so a room overlooking the park was perfect for fireworks they said. you can't imagine my disappointment! the display was in front of the westin hotel and our view was totally blocked by the westin. the room did not have a micro wave. the fridge was so small i could only put a few items in it and i need to travel with certain items because of my health. the bathroom was small and the tub/shower was no different than any cheap hotel. the shower spray was so weak, i couldn't rinse out my shampoo. they supplied a hair dryer. this was hysterical, its wire was only about 20 long, so i couldn't reach the back of my hair to dry with it! the bed had clean sheets but was very lumpy and uncomfortable. the peach jelly beans in the lobby was the nicest feature.\"ok, so the ritz is supposed to be great , right. not so here. i attended a networking conference in atlanta and was quite surprised to find the rooms very expensive and outdated. first of all the building is old, not in a historical way, but in a 1970's way. very unappealing. the rooms at a residence inn are larger, better appointed, and are much less expensive. beware, the rooms at the ritz have a stocked refrigerator, but do not remove anything from the refrigerator, even for a few moments unless you are intent on purchasing it, since there is a sensor which automatically charges the item to your room and you will be disputing charges when you check out. you would never know this, unless, you read all the fine print on the refrigeartor placard. make sure you don't get charged for a bottle of water inadvertantly either. my particular room had a droning noise from an air conditioning unit in the next room which pulsed on and off all night. i reported it, but to no availl. everything here is expensive. breakfast was $25 for a buffet plus tip, really ? for some scrambled eggs, coffee, toast, and some fruit. ugh. bar just as expensive. you can eat out if you hike it across the street to the shopping mall, but to get there you have to walk about half a mile down and around a highway over a bridge, otherwise you have to run the guantlet across an enormous intersection. not recommended. be careful. the staff were plentiful and courteous, but how many times do you need someone to open a door or say hello. i must say that i would have preferred to have stayed at a residence inn, but none were nearby. this ritz was quite a hike from the atlanta airport and the cab fare which was pricey as well. not coming back..........this was my first time staying at a ritz-carlton and i must say that i was disappointed. everything was good until my fiancee went to close the curtains as we were going to bed. that's when she spotted blood all over the curtains. we called the front desk and two employees came up and looked at it and said it had been there for a while. they did say they would move us to another room. but it was midnight and we had everything unpacked. they said they would have the general manager call us the next morning and we never heard from him. though they did offer to change our room i would have thought they may have had someone come and quickly clean it or replace the curtains. also by finding this i wonder how many other things were not clean in the room.my husband and i stayed here for one night while visiting atl. nothing special. needs a serious facelift. not going back. the ritz in buckhead is nicer. however, staff was great. valet was great. hotel is old and run down. bathroom is tiny. had used lotion bottle on counterwell.....i will tell you....check in is important to me. this check in was not smooth at all. i got there and was not welcomed as a platinum member, i waited several minutes for someone to be able to help me at front desk, i asked about the the club level access for platinum members....they informed me that that wasn't available at the ritz only at marriott.....i had called to ask before i came and was told it was so that is why i booked the room.....apparently ritz carlton's can make local decisions as to honor this perk thru marriott or not to honor......the girl at front desk offered to sell me the club level for my two nights and i declined and informed her to what i was told....a manager came over to help.....told me that the club level was fully committed\" ...i informed her up the upsell that i had declined....she then informed me that it wasn't available for two nights only one....this just didn't sit well with me because i was clearly offered two nights just moments before....no sincere apologies....just lie after lie....i checked into my room it was nicely decorated but the bed was awful and the tv was worse...i decided to make another reservation for the nights in question and low and behold.....i made one for two nights on the club level.....i waited for my reservation to come thru went to a meeting and then came back by and the same story was still in place at the front desk.....i then informed them of my other reservation i had made....they looked it up and to the surprise of the manager she found i had the club level for two nights...she stammered and sidestepped and i just reminded her that some people will climb a tree to tell a lie than stand on the ground and tell the truth.....finally she informed me that this \"one\" time she would extend the club level...she kept emphasizing the \"one\" time. oh i went to the club level....stayed 90 minutes each evening and shared a large room with 6 other people.......stayed 60 minutes during each breakfast......and shared same large room with 4 people...didn't really appear to ever be fully committed....my pillows never got any better, nor did my bed, and my tv just had a mind of its own. would not recommend at all at this point\"we spent the night at the ritz carlton atlanta for a bowl game downtown. we live in the same city but expected a treat and special night out downtown. the fee $369.00 including breakfast and valet ($50 + $30 value). i will say that from check in to check out the staff was up to and above ritz carlton standards - excellent all the way!! however, at checkin, i overheard another customer confirm her room price as $169.00 = really?? then as i got to our room (requested a higher floor and view), our view was of a brick wall (for $369.00 ??!! really) and i wore my socks the entire time in the room, because the carpet was filthy. the dust ruffle on both beds were thread worn and nasty - really, i was appalled that this was a ritz carlton and i was already paying awards of $400 for this over worn and questionably clean room. i love this chain and will stay in them again, but never this hotel. feel like we were ripped off and being regular clients, taken advantage of - had a great time at our event, but with what cost?? management needs to address the budget motel furnishings of this hotel. guess we will go to buckhead next time.where do i even begin? i suppose at the beginning. we valet parked and walked into a jam-packed lobby reminiscent of checking in at a vegas strip hotel. we waited in line to check-in. i think when you pay the kind of money you pay to stay at a ritz carlton there should not be check-in lines like the one we experienced. our room was nice. we were on the concierge level on the 24th floor. issues with the room: it was above a billboard that constantly changed color and the drapes could not block out the flashes of brightness throughout the night in this room. in addition, the red light on the phone would not stop blinking. the alarm clock by the bed was so bright i had to put a towel over it. even the smoke detector had a too-bright blinking light. very difficult to get a peaceful dark room here. lots of hallway noise and banging. we may have been across the hall from a utility closet. and, by the way, they should know that you cannot make an old mattress comfortable by putting a feather bed on top of it. the bathrobe hanging in the bathroom looked dirty and had pen marks on it. the products provided have such a strong smell they are offensive. they retrofitted the bathroom with a raised sink that takes up all of the counter space. i did not find a blowdryer in the room.we ordered in-room dining for an afternoon snack. i ordered a chicken quesadilla -- pretty simple, right? it was basically an empty fried tortilla. so gross.had a late dinner at the atlanta grill in the hotel. the service was terrible. no one there to greet us when we walked in. we were initially seated at a terrible table at the entrance and right in front of the band. we asked to move to a different table. no one came to get our drink order. i had to get up and speak with the hostess about the lack of service. service throughout the meal was inattentive. at one point they comped my drink because they'd forgotten to put in my order and i had to ask again for a cocktail. this is not a cheap hotel restaurant. it's quite pricey. i was shocked at the bad service. as for the food, i had soup and salad. there was so much dressing on the salad i couldn't eat it. my boyfriend loved his seafood dish, though!ate at the atlanta grill for the breakfast included in our package. yet again a long line to get in. being unsure of whether i needed to give them my name i walked in, there was no hostess, when she arrived i told her we had a party of two and she was about to seat us when a guest yelled at me for jumping the line. it was so disorganized how was i to know?!? i had already asked another guest about the line and he didn't seem to know. i was so embarrassed i walked out, waited a bit and then came back in. while we waited 15 minutes to be seated other guests were asking us questions about being seated for breakfast. terrible service yet again. then we're seated at a table. two servers came by and messed with the two extra place settings. no server offered us beverages. when the third server came by he asked if we were still waiting for the rest of our party. what rest of our party???? we asked for a table for two. the hostess obviously screwed it up. probably why we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. and why, even if we were waiting for other people which we were not, did they not offer us coffee or tea or water or anything??? the food was average.we go to leave and are told that we cannot call ahead to have our car brought up because it's so busy. and that we should just come down with our valet ticket and wait for them to get our car.positives of our stay: the concierge level lounge was lovely. manuela gives excellent service there. she should be running the whole hotel. also, they have nice towels in the room.perhaps i had high expectations because this is a ritz carlton hotel. shouldn't i have had high expectations? i would've been happier and more comfortable at a holiday inn express. never again ritz carlton. never again.we are members of the frequent users of this hotel chain. there were individuals on this trip who meet and exceeded the standards we expect. the driver randy and the somolie were two. the room was that of a basic holiday inn and the lounge was as tacky as it could be with high backed velvet seats and glass balls lit,someone has even taken a perfectly good chrystal chandelier and wrapped screens around them in an effort to look contemporary. the meal would have been wonderful and was in many ways had it not been for one peice of under cooked foie gras that made me sick and kept me up all night. thankfully there are two in atlanta.what a lovely place to stay. very close to the marta and world of coca cola. once again, valet parking at a price, but that is the same as anywhere else here. we didn't eat at the hotel, it was our last stop before having to fly home.this is how it's supposed to be done. every gm out there should visit the ritz and take notes. the only negative is the $32/nt parking fee!i have to admit the hotel is located in a part of time that might not have the best of people walking around at night, but its close to everything downtown.the restaurant and bar service was good. i had a great night sleep until i found out that i might have been sleeping on dirty sheets. there was a few bottles of waters that were opened already before i got into the room as well.the manager was accommodating when i brought these things to their attention. i really didn't want anything from them at all, but i was really upset regardless of them offering to make my stay more comfortable. i would have just been happy with a clean from the beginning.it's a shame i have to write this review since it was the first time staying at a ritz i just hope they are able to make a better first impression next time i stay at one of their properties.my wife and i have stayed here many times. that being said, this time was not very good. upon arrival, we found a wet, dirty wash cloth hanging in the closet but didn't let it bother us too much. our first night we ate at the atlanta grill within the hotel and it was horrible, which was unusual. i had breakfast there my last day and it was also bland. we ended up leaving a day early because we just felt uncomfortable at the hotel. the service was still outstanding though!really, ritz carleton, an hour and a half for a room service sandwich? five star hotel, ten greeters n the lobby, the shining star of the opulent accomidations\" and \"unsurpassed service\" and it takes an hour and a half to produce a blt?you are surprised that you have \"unusually high volume\" in market week in atlanta, that your hotel is full and a lot of people want to eat. let me help you for next market, a lot of people are coming and they are going to want to eat. perhaps you could figure out how to get them room service before 10pm in the intervening six months. wouldn't it be nice if there were a chain of five star hotels that provided quality service?i know it snowed four days ago, and you are helpless as a result, and it will be years before you completely recover. great job, though.\"my husband & i went to atlanta to watch the sec championship game. it was my first time leaving our 4 month old son, whom i exclusively breastfeed. before storing pumped milk in the fridge in our room, i asked the bellman for permission. he assured me it was fine & it would be a safe place to keep the milk i pumped for my son. we had stayed the night before at another hotel in atlanta, so i had a total of 22 ounces of milk already. we left for the game at 3pm atlanta time. when we returned to our room following the game, we noticed the sheets had been turned down on the bed with a chocolate & weather forecast for the following day. i proceeded to pump & when i went to the fridge to put my milk away, i could not find my milk! we had also put 4 mini waters in the fridge & they were missing as well. when i called downstairs, i reached a staff member at the front desk. after telling her my problem, she transferred me to another area where i was put on hold. i had been on hold for about 5 minutes when i hung up & called back. this time i was told that the manager would contact me. when the manager called me, i explained my issue to him. he told me he would look into\" the matter & would call me back. a man then came up to the room to \"run a scan\" on the key slot to see who had been in our room. it showed only one key, which was the staff member who had come in for the turndown service. he assured me he would speak with the employee & would call me back. when he called back, he was stuttering, mumbling & was not speaking in a professional manner. he told me that the maid had \"denied taking the milk from the fridge\" & that \"she said she had no reason to be in our fridge.\" she was exactly right...she had no reason to be in our fridge since we had just checked in only 6 hours earlier & she was in our room solely to turn down the beds. however, when you steal a diamond ring out of someone's bag, you have no reason to be in their bag, correct? i was speechless. i felt as though i was being called a liar. then the manager stated \"mam, what would you like us to do?\" i wanted my milk back!!!! not that i would feed it to my baby now, but i wanted a good explanation & an apology (the manager never apologized to me). when i told him i thought our room should be taken care of, he chuckled & said \"mam, i don't know that we can do that.\" i felt like i was not being taken seriously since this was \"only breastmilk\" & not something of a greater monetary value. however, if you'll ask any mother who has ever pumped an ounce of breastmilk, 22 ounces of breastmilk is quite valuable! i had spent my time & my body had produced that milk to nourish my child. also, this was a reputable hotel which i trusted to respect my property! in the end, they only offered us 50% off of the room which we accepted, however, it did not make things right for me. i was out 22 ounces of breastmilk, plus i lost my sense of security and my night was ruined! we spoke to a 3rd manager the next morning at checkout & his response to the situation was \"we train our staff to a certain degree\" & \"we've never had anything like this happen before \" & \"this employee has been here for quite some time.\" again, i felt as though i was being called a liar! what happened to \"the customer is always right?\" we were asked by the 3rd manager to leave a business card & he would be in touch with us. a week later, we have yet to hear from him. so, in the end my first getaway since my son was born ended up being more of a stressor rather than an enjoyable weekend away.\"in general this is a very fine hotel, but not quite up to ritz carlton standards. first the good: the staff is excellent, very helpful and friendly. the bed is very comfortable. very centrally located. decor is modern and rooms are nicely appointed, spacious with flat screens, ipod players, and easy to use alarm clocks.the annoyances (e.g. things i expect better from a hotel of this caliber): the robe in the room was stained, there were no slippers, the soaps are heavily perfumed, shower had some mold in the corner, missed turn-down service one night, served a breakfast fruit plate with unripe and low quality fruit, room key must be used in elevator to access all guest rooms at all times. gym is small converted suite. (but, equipment is new and in good working order with tvs. water, fruit and fresh headphones are provided.)if you stay in 5-star hotels often, you will not be aghast at this property, but you will notice there are small details left unattended.from the moment you have the doors opened, this hotel proves itself as the model of gentile and excellent service. rooms are not huge, but excellently furnished and beds are some of the best.it's the service though, that makes this smallish hotel a five star in my mind.i left the hotel on a similar note to the one i entered on, disappointed.i was disappointed in the lack of that luxurious feeling you usually get when in the lobby of a ritz. and i left in a hurry because the lack of service included (but wasn't limited to) a missed wake up call.the room was nice, but not spectacular which is how i'd describe the restaurant as well.i love the ritz carlton brand. i have stayed at their property in philadelphia on several occasions. i needed to attend an event in atlanta and decided to stay at the ritz carlton downtown. i was very impressed by the door man, and left him a nice tip. i was very disappointed with the room. it was extremely dated. there was also a very bad smell in the room. days after leaving the hotel, i can still remember how awful it was. when i asked to move rooms, i was told that all the rooms are the same. i cannot believe that the ritz brand would countenance these poor room standards. the service was otherwise quite good. they had taken the trouble to make sure that all the bedding was non allergenic as i had requested. hopefully they will update their rooms to the ritz carlton standard in the near future.this property is far below the rc standard. my sister and i took our granddaughters for 2 nights in order to attend momma mia\" at the fox and to have \"high tea\".....the fox was great but the tea was a joke. for the little ones...peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with bar-b-q potato chips! the hotel is old and shabby. we stayed on club level and enjoyed the food and service in the club lounge. overall, the personnel were all courteous and attentive but the property is very disappointing. buckhead is far better and tea there is what it should be. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone. it is a short walk from centenial park where there is a new embassy suites so check that out before making a selection. i would not feel safe to walk from this hotel at night. the concierge advised us to order room service after the theatre rather than walk 1/2 a block to a mcdonalds.\"i recently stayed at the ritz in downtown atlanta with my sister and we were rather disappointed. the walls were very thin and we could hear everything going on in the hallway and adjoining rooms. the bath towels were very hard and crunchy; someone obviously forgot the fabric softener. one of them had stains on it as well! my sister had booked the room for two, but there was only one rather flimsy robe in the closet. the air conditioning in the room was rather loud turning on and off too. well, we decided to have dinner saturday night in the hotel's restaurant and immediately noticed that the white, fabric table cloth was quite wrinkled and the glass vase on the table was pretty dirty. the service, however, was quite good and our meals overall were enjoyable. although we have stayed in many hotels over the years, neither of us had stayed at a ritz carlton. i'd like to say that perhaps our expectations were too high, but honestly, i would give higher marks to other hotels that are considered below\" the level of the ritz. a decent stay i guess, but a bit of a let down.\"always try to stay at a ritz when i can on business. was in atlanta last weekend on business and checked in on saturday, called the day ahead to confirm early arrival and was assured room would be ready at 11 am when i arrived. room not ready at 11am, was not ready until 3pm, had to change clothes in lobby bathroom to get to a meeting.got to hotel late after meeting, called to concierge to get dinner reservation in dining room, was told it was fully committed for the evening, got changed and went down to front desk to inquire on a restaurant close by the hotel and asked about ding room again, she told me i could go to restaurant and try, they always tell people its full when you call. talk about crazy. go to ritz restaurant and get a table no problem, food was ok, service was terrible.got up at 8am, go to shower, no hot water. call down to desk, am told its normal, too many people trying to use hot water at this hour, completely not acceptable in my book. take cold shower and head off to work. next morning have a flight at 1 pm, so i sleep in and shower at 10 am, still no hot water, call down and get the same story, another cold shower.the ritz did comp me 1 nights stay for the water problem, but how many times can a hotel do this, why not fix the problem.this property was just not up to the ritz standard, not crisp and clean, more like a 3 star hotel.we checked in late, front office staff were great, went to our room, to find out that the bathroom has not been cleaned and restocked with soap, towels, robes and shampoos, dirty towels were still there, we called house keeping, they responded fast. when we went back to sleep, my wife started itching, she woke me up, i looked at her legs, there she had itchy bumps on her skin, were wrote off as allergy, but the following night she had more of those all over her body and i started itching too but i felt some stinging with itching, i checked my skin and to my suprise i had flea bites all over my body and my wife had the sam, we contacted the front office, they appologized, they accepted cnahging our room, and promised to relay that to the management, but never heard from them i asked the clerk twice in following two day to have management call me they never did, never aknowledge the problem, or send me at least a letter of apology. i expected an adjustment of the the first two nights we stayed ther suffering from those fleas, they adjusted only one night, the night the y moved us to the new room close to midnight. i will never go again there, your site should rate this hotel at the bottom of the list of hotels in atlanta downtown.if it were not a ritz carlton i would look past the worn carpet in the lobby, the moldering furniture by one of the entrances. in the room, the tub/shower drain was slow and the tub did not seem clean. the phone was disgustingly dirty. under the bed, a few treats including a moldering cookie. i had a time sensitive package waiting for me upon arrival but it was given to me, with some prodding, at check out. on the plus side, bedding was comfortable the fabric on the furniture was stain free. the lobby bar staff is excellent and they have a piano player in the early evening and you don't have to be a guest to enjoy it. it just doesn't feel like a ritz carlton, next time it's the 4 seasons.for our anniversary, my husband and i decided to splurge, leave the kids at the grandparents and spend the night at the ritz. a girlfriend did the same thing with her husband, except that she chose the buckhead location. she was smarter. i booked a package that included tickets to the high museum. upon checkin, they told me that the tickets were still in the concierge vault\" and they would have them sent to our room. 45 minutes later, still no word. we call to the front desk, they tell us they are working on it. about 15 minutes after that, my husband went down to the desk. he called up and said they were telling him i had booked a completely different package; this was a package that was not even available at the time i made the reservation. after a few more back and forths, we finally got our tickets and were on our way. the room was fine, but nothing special except for the bed, which was heavenly! in trying to get our car for dinner that night, we spent about 30 minutes just waiting for the understaffed valet area to bring our car, making us late for our dinner reservations. that night, they were thoughtful and sent a bottle of champagne to our room for our anniversary. the breakfast at the restaurant was great and the level of service was definitely what i expect from the ritz. however, upon leaving, the valet once again took forever - they took our ticket, saw us standing there for 30 minutes, but didn't say anything. i finally followed up when i saw people who were there after us getting their cars; they never even put us in the lineup! my keys were still sitting in the valet box. no apology, either. not impressed overall for the money we spent. stay at the buckhead ritz for a definite \"ritz\" experience.\"i opted to stay in the ritz carlton instead of less expensive area hotels when attending a wedding in the ritz ballroom because i wanted a little luxury. boy did i waste my money! the room was adequate but the carpet had stains which were either rust (i hope) or blood (shudder!) and the bathroom was not as clean as i am accustomed to in hotels of this (supposed) caliber. there was mildew on the shower tiles and dust in the corners of the floor. my shower never actually worked properly and was not fixed despite repeated phone calls to the front desk and the concierge. another annoying detail was that the sheets did not fit my bed. i felt like my bed had been short sheeted and every time i woke up the none too sanitary mattress was exposed. finally we had sunday brunch at the atlanta grill which was outrageously overpriced. the food was good but i could have done without watching swarms of flies land on the fruit, vegetables and cold bar. also, i am still waiting for the omelet they promised to bring to my table. when i return the atlanta on business i certainly will not stay here!my wife and i just spent 2hrs. haggling with reservations and the front desk. we were planning an anniversary trip and, as we had stayed here before, we decided to stay again. we stayed on the concierge level (24th floor) before and desired to do the same. making our plans we were told a specific rate by reservations which were then changed by the front desk of the hotel to a higher rate.....almost $150.00 more per night. the only way we found out about the higher rate was by calling the front desk after speaking with reservations in an attempt to confirm our good rate through reservations....however, we were met by the front desk with the higher rate and a hostile, you get what you pay for!\".....if i could have jumped through the phone...i would have......politely spoken with the \"chap\" over tea. needless to say we cancelled our reservations and will search elsewhere....the moral of all of this...verify your reservations with the front desk to make sure you're not being overcharged.\"i've stayed at numerous intercontinental hotels, mostly in the u.s. this hotel is nice, but to me it doesn't meet the standards of those in la, new york, dc. check-in was uneventful, and i don't think the staff member said more than maybe 10 words. late-afternoon after my first night, there was no signs of housekeeping, so i had to call and make a request. as an ambassador member, i was looking forward to an upgrade to a suite, but was told there were none available. they did offer a $50 food and beverage credit instead. to summarize my stay, there seems to be a lack of attention to details, and an unwillingness to anticipate the needs of the guests.fhr disappointment. dirty room, one phone didn't work. 1 bottle of water, which is fine, except that there were 2 of us. asked for 2 robes and slippers, took 45 mins and they brought one of each and left at door. $73 for 1 egg and 1 coffee. they said well, your breakfast is included\". that wasn't the point. manager was unhelpful and didn't even care to try and do the right thing. valet parking was overpriced.i don't normally bash a hotel, when they try and make things right and give you the value for money you are spending, but this was just bad. fortunately it was one night and had it not been 11 pm when we arrived, i would have gone somewhere else.while i am sure there are some \"decent\" rooms, be wary on weekends as there are weddings. our floor party lasted til 2 am. :)just know what you are getting into with this property. it needs a renovation and some customer service lessons to gain this world traveller back again.\"for a 5 star hotel the bed was lumpy and there was an actual wooden slat underneath the mattress. also our tv went out and i had to call several times to get someone to do anything about it. we had high hopes for this hotel.customer service was excellent. smelled nice. parking was normal pricing given that it is buckhead. if i had time i would have me one complaint but i had to do a digital checkout due to exigent circumstances. the tv system flat out sucked. signal was unbelievably horrible. it almost did not work. also i requested toothpaste as i forgot some. it was supposed to be delivered and never was. so minus 1 star for those two issues. again i had to check out from my phone so i never gave management a chance to correct it internally which is why i'm not giving a worse rating.i decided to stay at the intercontinental for business. it is part of the fine hotels series through american express. you get different upgrades and perks for being a part of the amex platinum service. i always try to book one through them because of this.when i checked in, i was told that they upgraded my room. i would have hated to see my original room if the room they put me in was an upgrade. it was very small, but had a view. i could hear everything happening in the room beside me. for a hotel of this caliber price, this should be unacceptable. this was a huge thumbs down for me. i would have rather had a quiet room versus any kind of view. i don‚äôt want to hear the person next door sneeze, watch tv or go to the bathroom. i am sure they felt the same way about me.the front door staff and the checkin persons were great. parking was totally overpriced and the food at the companion restaurant, southern art, was mediocre. even though the location is great, there are many other options in this part of buckhead. i most likely will choose another hotel next time i am in town.the bellman, and valet's were absolutely stellar at this place! every day they would greet us and ask us how our day went or what we were going to do. my kids loved telling them about their adventures everyday. the room was clean, and the view was nice. the dining staff and room service waiters were fantastic, they really made you feel like you were royalty.the beds were small and uncomfortable. the rooms with the 2 beds are really still made for just two people that sleep in separate beds. it was cramped trying to fit a family of 4 in the room. the front desk staff (with the exception of tony) was terrible. there were incorrect charges from the mini bar that had to be adjusted, then they got the room rate wrong that had to be adjusted, on top of that they tried to charge almost $2,000 worth of incidentals holds on top of the holds mentioned below.just a warning to those that go to this hotel. i found out that on top of the $100 per night incidental charge, they charge an additional $100 anytime you charge something to your room. for example, for a two night stay they would charge you $200 on top of your nightly room rate (no big deal as this is standard in hotel industry), i order room service for $80, instead of taking the $80 from the $200, they will charge you and additional $100 plus the 80, thus increasing the total incidental hold from $200 to $380. i stayed for three nights (150/night) and ended up with $1,500 and change hold on my money. i even got a fraud alert from my bank because they kept charging my card so much. i have never been in a hotel that charges like that, and it was my first time staying at this hotel so it would have really been nice if they told me that when i checked into the hotel.hopefully this review can spare at least one person the surprise and stress of going through thatmy husband was so sweet to plan a babymoon staycation for the 2 of us before i gave birth to our daughter. we were so excited for a night away just the 2 of us. it was our first time to stay at an intercontinental. being 9 months pregnant for this trip we were just wanting a comfortable room to relax and be lazy in together. my night was pretty bad to say the least. i called the front desk and asked for 2 extra pillows 3 different times over a 2.5 hour period of time. i was told each time they would put a rush on it\" to housekeeping, yet still no pillows were brought. again...9 months pregnant and i just needed the extra pillows to get comfortable. i was exhausted and finally gave up on calling shortly after midnight. i have never stayed at a hotel and had the front desk/housekeeping ignore a request for pillows. after the third time calling, i thought for sure someone would bring them, but instead the lady i spoke with sounded annoyed by my call instead of helpful. the next morning, my husband used the restroom and the toilet overflowed (not from a clog we could have caused). the maintenance man was super friendly and arrived right away. he is the reason i am not writing a 1 star review. he took care of the toilet and gave us new towels. he let us know housekeeping would be in shortly to clean the floor. our \"wonderful\" housekeepers never arrived. we stayed until checkout time just to see if they would show and they never did. i had to go from the 14th floor to the lobby just to use a restroom that wasn't covered in toilet water. pretty gross. around 9am we did get a visit from a man checking to see what items we used from the mini bar he could charge us for (we didn't use anything). that was sweet....we only had the do not disturb sign off the door so housekeeping would know they could come in, but instead we got someone wanting to check that while we were still in our pajamas. there are so many buckhead hotels to choose from and i so wish we would have stayed somewhere else. we will not make the same mistake again.\"internet at this hotel is joke and no one care when you call for help. front desk don't even know if they have any help desk. this is the worst hotel experience of my life. carpet in the room is dirty and smelly. never again at this place.as an ihg ambassador, i expected better -we checked in at 9pm and our room was not ready -the bathroom was untidy and there were no amenities.very disappointedthe location was great and the breakfast was goodbut the service and room were disappointing .luckily our room had a great view, but everything else was second rate fom the sheets to the towels to the unclean carpet. staff was pleasant and obliging, but not well trained. it would seem that management is not on top of their job.i spend an average of $40,000 a month traveling and only staying at hotels that american express considers fine hotels. this is definitely not one of them and some how made the list (i can only assume because of art smith‚äôs restaurant....which is delicious). i have only ever written one other review in my life and it was for the outstanding service from the four seasons whistler. i can give you a whole list of reasons as to why you should steer clear of this hotel until they get their house in order but i not you have time for that. trust me as a constant luxury traveler, do not stay here. by the way, a week later i am still waiting for a call from one of the ‚äúmanagers‚äù who was supposed to call. at my hotel or one of my many other hospitality driven businesses we would have cleaned house by now and we would be embarrassed if this was our hotel.the bathroom makes or break a stay for me. this one did not disappoint. loved the soaking tub. (so did my wife). everything else was as fine as you would expect for the price point. amazing view and breakfast to die forthe building is nice looking, if a bit dated in some places. the set up shows a trend towards modern. we arrived a bit early and the place was empty, but at about 9pm, the lobby bar was packed. the pool was trying its best to be appealing, but was just decent and the hot tub felt well over 104 degrees. the room itself had a nicely tiled bathroom and quality looking fixtures, but upon further inspection, were not quality at all. the handle to the cold water fell off, the water in the shower randomly changed temperatures, the refrigerator was broken, the bed was uncomfortable, and we could hear the crying baby above us all night. we could see parts of the room (such as the glass in the shower) where they skimp on cleaning. i tried calling the hotel lobby and was put on hold for 30 minutes before just giving up. i would recommend best western before i'd recommend this places.we travel a lot and this hotel was way overpriced. we stayed in an executive suite. the bedroom was small a cramped with too much furniture. the faucet handle on our sink came off. hotel was full so they didn't have time to fix it. we asked for an extra blanket and they were out. housekeeping came mid afternoon and gave us some towels and didn't take the dirty ones away. the staff was nice, but the hotel tried to be high end and charge like it, but didn't come close to giving the value for the money. lastly, my sister went to breakfast, just to sit down and talk to another family member and they said to sit down, they would charge her 25.00 for breakfast.the reservations process for a group reservation was unsatisfactory. personnel were rude and not able to resolve a problem. there seems to be great inconsistency between their web site and telephone reservations. ended up going to a higher ranked property for a better deal and nicer staff. i would advise getting all details in writing and not relying on the internet or telephone reservations. this staff does not meet ritz carlton levels of service.2nd anniversary make up for last terrible experience at intercontinental ruined! my husband is a cable engineer as he travel 90 percent of the time and with our family for only 10 percent. our time is very precious. last year we celebrated our 11 year anniversary together at intercontinental which would have been our 4th time..entire anniversary was ruined by room not ready when said, rude and nasty front desk lady. so we were told by guest relations manager, mira that they will accommodate us with an executive king suite on the house. we original requested a grand suite last year so i suggested that we can pay difference between king executive suite and grand suite. mira, guest relations mgr said when we are ready to give her a week so she she can set it up..so we did just that but no response after 1 entire month!, my wife reached out to general manager garisomos..he apologized and asked me what would should i like him to do..it was abiously that he was not going to suggest anything else so i just asked him to keep the arrangement that was arrangedkept with the guest relations mgr which general manager said was fine. he also said that he apologize and we should expect a special gift: in the room. when we got in the room there was no special gift. my husband called front desk and advised that a gift was to be in the room she apologies and said when staff attempted to come up in the room, do not disturb sign was on. we advised front desk that we were going too a concert and will call them once were get in. front desk lady said fine and she will leave a note for staff member on next shift. we came back from concert and called front desk man..told him that we were back and then can bring this \"gift\" up to the room..he paused and said he was very sorry but he had no idea what i was talking about and transferred me to room service.they had not idea what i was talking about and told me that the only gift that they know cost eighty bucks. smh. we then get transferred back to front desk man and he was very apologetic but had not clue what we were talking about. front desk man said he will contact the mgr on duty maybe a note was left....came back to the phone and he apologized and said \"no note left and my manager has no idea what we are talking about. at this point is was obvious that we not getting this \"gift\" to add event to injury..we are ambassador members as we are to have 4 pm late check out. i called in the day of check out requesting a late check out..the front desk coordinator said...sorry i can only give you until 1 pm. i again advised that we are ambassador member's.. front desk lady said..okay i will give you until 2..serious..so my wife contacted ambassador member service and it took the member services to call the front desk and speak to the manager on duty the next day to get a late check out. it is going to take a hell of a miracle for us to come back to this hotel. they do not do what they are going to say, they did not honor the early check and we had to fight for the late check out. if i may say that our visit in 2015 was heaven. seems like customer service has went down the toilet. there is absolutely no communication between staff..note to mgmt make sure your team is communicating with one another especially if it is at the customers expense. dont say that you are apologetic on how we were treated before and this time we do not get treated at all. not impressed for a 5 star hotel\"this hotel staff and security treated my fiance and myself terribly. after being told we could use the business center for a casting by a nice staff member, hotel security came in impersonating an officer and pulled me out of the business center. i was subsequently accused of not checking into the hotel and asked to provide my credit card to be charged again. i provided proof through my chase app that i had indeed checked in and was fully paid. the security then went and took my fiance out of the room telling her she couldn't be in there. after speaking to each other they finally realized that we had indeed checked in, paid, and were giving permission to use the business center for the one-hour casting we put together.this was an embarrassing and demeaning experience and i would never want to stay at an intercontinental again. i've stayed at intercontinentals from san francisco to sydney. never again after being treated the way i was treated.this hotel gave me the worst experience this year throughout all my business and personal trips.1. cannot sleep due to the party noise coming from the lobby after midnight. i called the front desk, but they didn't care.2. wrong charges. after i left the hotel, i called the front desk, but they didn't promptly correct the bill. finally, amex helped to correct the bill. thanks amex!i am going to start off by saying: i would not suggest booking a room here!allow me to further explain my situation. my wife and i had to fly into atlanta for 2 days in november for a quick business meeting. like usual, we booked our hotel room and assumed everything would go smoothly. after a very long day, we arrived at the hotel around 8:30pm. there appeared to be a few businessmen waiting around in the lobby looking quite aggravated so we know something was going on. after a 45 minute wait, a very green front desk girl informed us that they had overbooked the hotel and we didn't have a room. they began frantically calling other hotels in the atl area, but all were booked up (we assume there was a large conference going on). after another hour wait, some sort of manager (bret poole or the like) came out to tell us the closest hotel was about 30 minutes out of the city but, not to worry, because of our error, you will be highly compensated.\" it was an absolute disaster. we were exhausted, had more work to do, and now had to deal with having no place to stay. we finally decided to call a relative and had them put us up for the night as we lost all faith in this hotel's ability to fix the problem.**now for the best part of the story!!** two weeks after this incident, we receive an email with our huge compensation!! here it comes: \"we are offering a free \"upgrade\" the next time you stay with us (but just for the amount of days you were originally suppose to stay with us)!\"to make a long story short, the same hotel which made our entire trip a disaster, now has the audacity to suggest we stay with them again?! after returning back to the office on monday, i immediately sent out an email to our company, strongly advising against booking any business stays here. we have almost 450,000 employees and i would rather pay 10x's the cost for a hotel, then ever trust the intercontinental buckhead atlanta again. you have a better chance of me sleeping in the emergency room of grady hospital then ever coming back for my pathetic upgrade.\"this is the second time we've used this location for a work conference and i must say that the staff is very accommodating. i've dealt extensively with the concierge, joan, and she has been nothing but accommodating and we can be quite demanding!my wife and i booked this hotel for our 23rd weeding anniversary. we typically book at the ritz or mandarin for special occasions in atlanta. however, on this trip we thought we would book the intercontinental and upgrade to the club level.we had read decent reviews, but upon arrival it was very clear that their is a drastic difference in the groups of people that expect real 5-star properties (mandarin, ritz) and those that have expectations of the intercontinental.in brief:the rooms are outdated, worn and desperately in need of updating. our room was a hideous orange-flesh color with 80-90's decor and color.the towels were terrible. we have had better quality towels at a holiday inn expressthe lamp shade had stains on it.the comforter had stains on it.the carpet was worn and had stains on it.the batroom tub had hair on it.the batroom was very average in size and lower in quality.the shower was smallthe furniture was outdated and worn.need i go on? at best, this property should be a 3 star in need of updating and removations.do yourself a favor and stay at the mandarin, ritz, four seasons, or even lowes.the only bit of good news is that the staff were excellent, polite and attentive.regardsgenerally our stay was fine but was defined by what i call a lack of maintenance and appropriate inspection of the room.every individual we interfaced with were exceptional in the service they provided.my issues are:1, a lack of quality food and variety on the club floor. it was disappointing when compared to other hotels we have stayed at.2. allowing smoking at the entry to the hotel. the stench is horrendous as they allow smokers of cigarettes and cigars to congregate at all the entrance doors instead of having a designated area off to the side away from the entrances.3. there was a lack of maintenance in the room which was annoying and just goes to the issue of how the hotel is rated.4. when there are large events at the hotel or large numbers of people checking out at once the driveway at the entrance is an absolute mess. drives wait in line to enter the property and to depart. we had to walk off premises to be picked up to go out for the evening.5. not certain if i would stay at this property again since there are a significant number of other hotels in the area.i really just don‚äôt know where to start with this review. first off, this is not a 5 star hotel, don‚äôt be fooled. we booked two rooms directly on the hotel website for two nights. we called ahead to say we would be arriving close to midnight, no problems with that. but even though there was no one else checking it, it still took close to 30 minutes to get our two rooms checked in! insane! they had someone else‚äôs credit card on file, they didn‚äôt seem to care that we are ihg platinum elite, they seemed to hardly be able to find our reservations or the fact that we booked two rooms.everything just kept going downhill from there. turndown had already visited the rooms, which was nice, but half the basic toiletries were missing... what 5 star hotel has no lotion in the bathroom? only two towels, only one thin as paper robe, had to ask for a basic toothbrush. the toilet seat was broken so it smacked you in the back each time you sat down... disgusting, the wallpaper was stained with who knows what in the bathroom, the comforter on the bed was stained, the shower had no water pressure, the black out curtains were so difficult to move and were half blocked behind the furniture so you couldn‚äôt really move them. i could really go on and on. i‚äôve had much better stays at basic 2 star hotels! also, don‚äôt waste your money in the restaurant. worst service... had to ask for things like water and silverware.don‚äôt except turndown service to be consistent either, only one of our rooms had turndown service more than once. the other room was abandoned.we had asked several times for our guaranteed late check out for being platinum elite. however, they checked out one room a few hours early so they were basically holding our belongings hostage. totally unacceptable.we had also prepaid for parking when we booked the rooms, it took 4 different calls to the front desk to get them to remove that extra charge from our bill.my only positive would be the valet service. super professional and friendly, always had our car ready and waiting within minutes, and always there to open doors and help with our bags. great staff out there!overall, this property is not up to par for being a ‚äú5 star‚äù hotel. don‚äôt waste your money expecting more than maybe a 3 star quality stay.we recently got married in a private ceremony on andros island, bahamas. we had planned on having a big reception in october after we came back. so we came home and started planning.we are diamond ambassadors at the intercontinental. we travel quite a lot so being a member should contribute for us with upgrades, club level and late check outs. i've felt the last few trips with an intercontinental stay has been anything, but an upgrade.:(we booked a suite online months ago in preparation for this event. we knew we would have a lot of out of town guests and family. planning a suite leaves plenty of room for people to come have a drink prior to the party of after. we had made arrangements for my make up/hairdresser and glam team to meet us at the hotel before the event so they could help get me ready.we arrived at the hotel a couple hours before the event. as we walked in we could see another wedding taking place and both admired just how beautiful it was. as we were waiting for the front desk people to check us in we heard the next few words that ended up ruining our special night!:(the guy behind the desk said ok mr. and mrs. g..,,we don't have the suite that you booked online, but we have already adjusted your rate by ten dollars to a king room\"! i told them we had to have a suite due to our plans, but their only response was the suites were gone...due to a wedding party some of which extended their stay so they didn't have our room anymore\"! i was so angry! \"come on\"! i told them that we were celebrating our wedding too and how could they book us a suite then let someone else take it\"!?!this argument went on for several minutes and no matter what i said or who i talked to we didn't have a suite! i was sick! at this point, we had no other option except to stay due to the time etc.they basically said \"we are sorry and if we had another suite they would just give it to us\", but they didn't!!!our night was ruined....as we had 6 people scrambling to get dressed at once we were late to our own reception! it was terrible. i understand things happen, but this was a huge mess up! not to mention this is about the third time in recent months we have experienced this same type of situation.i'm truly disappointed by the intercontinental and their reaction to this entire thing! this is all about customer service and when you are in the hosting business you better make the customers happy! you would think if for any other reason except that people can write reviews on \"trip advisor\" right?payback! yes, i feel like someone has actually heard my complaints!so before joining some fancy membership program read the dotted lines! i haven't seen the benefits at all to this point!:(we will take our business elsewhere....when we book a suite that's exactly what we expect! don't you???tiffany\"my husband and i stay at intercontinental hotels all over the world each year, and have had good experiences, so i booked two rooms for hurricane irma at this hotel for my parents and siblings. after arriving at the hotel, we explained the rooms should be on their credit cards.in the rooms, the bed mattresses had collapsed and they were not able to get one if the rooms feather free for 3 nights.on check out, there was no itemized bill available.both my credit card and my parents‚äô were billed. through speaking with two managers, candice and christine, over a two week period, we managed to get the billing onto the correct credit card. neither were aware that a aaa rate exists and was the rate booked for this stay. on one evening, one of these managers disconnected my call 7 times before answering the call and addressing me by name, so i knew she had the caller id!to date, we have not been able to get a date of service itemized bill.two voicemails have been left for the hotel‚äôs main manager, mr campbell black and have gone unreturned.what terrible management here and what a disservice to the intercontinental chain!everything was great but rooms were not ready until hours after they were promised. for this level of hotel that is unacceptable. also many inconsistencies in information given by staff. small issues required talking to multiple people and then advice given was wrong or changed by the next person. everyone was friendly but not on the same page. again, not acceptable for this level of hotel. this isn't a motel 6 but the training of the staff is at that level.great location on peachtree road, among several 5 star hotels, however after the poor level of customer service i received. i will no longer patronize any of the ihg property's. regardless of religion, race, or sexual preference, everyone deserves fair and equal treatment.after having intercontinental over this past weekend as a last-minute impromptu birthday gift for my mother. we live in the neighborhood not far from there and decided to switch from the ritz to the intercontinental i thought i would be a very refreshing change, was i sadly disappointed. upon checking i was greeted by a very nice young man named scott who got me all checked in very friendly very helpful i thought that this was surely a positive indicator for how the rest of my experience would be again i was sadly mistaken. upon arriving in the room we noticed that there was only one set of towels the light bulb on the side table was missing i'm optimistic and pretty understanding so those things weren't a huge deal. the worst part of our stay with their was our interaction we had with the night front desk manager. ms. shim. we had a situation where we ordered some food from the cheesecake factory and it arrived ice cold and very late so as a courtesy i asked was there anyway i could at least warm up my son's food anywhere in the hotel, at this point it's up about 12:30 a.m. i just got finished dealing with a crisis with his food and i was literally in tears begging this lady please just can she help me figure out a way to heat up my son's food so that he can eat and go to bed she informed me that possibly the kitchen could have said to me and transferred me to them they of course that no but they said that housekeeping have microwaves that they should be able to let me use just to heat his food and transfer me back to ms. shim. she informed me there will be a $50 charge to heat up my child's food and i just simply asked her is there any way she could do it as a courtesy the $50 isn't a big deal but i just thought that was a little absorbent just to heat up one plate she said that there was nothing she could do and unfortunately they are not allowed to do that as a courtesy at a five-star hotel i just expected so much more i felt like the experience was cheapened by what felt like i was being nickeled and dimed i just didn't expect after paying close to $300 a night to stay somewhere that such a courtesy couldn't be extended even just out of the kindness of her heart like i said i was in tears she was not moved and just continue to repeat that she wish that there was something she could do but there was nothing that she could do which only made matters worse. tashauna apologized for this experience upon checkout, the only silver lining to this dark cloudwe stayed here sept 22-24. the hotel is in a good location, but we might as well have stayed at a holliday inn.1. the sink was clogged, which was gross2. the tv was satellite and it was in and out every 30 seconds, it was very annoying.3. the bar downstairs had the worst service. we sat there for over 5 minutes with the bartender there passing us back and forth. we were lright in front of him. he did not acknowledge us once. he could have said ladies i'll be right with you\" or \"hello\"4. they also locked us out of our room even though i called to make sure our checkout was set at 12 pm which is their normal checkout. they wouldn't let us back in. we had to wait 10 minutes for someone to let us in, although the guy who called for them to send someone had a key. and we were on a schedule in order to get to airport on time.i don't know how this place has 5 stars.the bellmen were very friendly as was the front desk, they were only good experience, but i wouldn't stay here again.\"be careful for the bait and switch...the check-in procedures were less than expected (like where is the elevator?); i was billed for breakfast that was supposed to be included in the room rate (yes, i booked directly on the hotel's site and paid more during booking for breakfast, but it is less expensive that way unless they bill you again for something you already paid for!); parking areas underground are poorly lit and not well marked; there were promises made by the front desk manager that were not carried through. on the positive side, the bathroom tub was very nice and the food was delicious. we ate all of our meals at the hotel. yes, i would eat here again but no, i would not choose to stay here again...find another choice for a room...there are plenty of choices close-by.first clue was none of the doormen greeted us when we pulled up or when we walked towards the door (except for the one who hit on my wife as she trailed behind with a boot on her foot). then there was the 20+ minute wait to check in. after carrying our bags to the room, we noticed a towel on the floor. it was covering a cold, wet spot that never dried during our stay. then the noise started. must have been both a wedding and a fraternity party on our floor. it sounded like they were in our room. complaints to the front desk did nothing to quiet the crowd - it may have made them louder. i admit i took a little joy when my sleepless, cranky son cried his way down the hallway at 8am the next morning. i hope he woke up at least one party goer. the doormen continued to ignore me, but holla at\" my wife as we got in our car to leave. disrespectful and disgraceful.\"my wife booked this hotel since it was very central to the training i was coming to town for. while the price was a bit more than we normally pay, we felt the service, amenities, and access by walking were worth it.the only problem i had and this problem will prevent me from staying here again is that the hotel prohibits the exercising of our 2nd amendment rights. i will not have my family stay at a hotel that disarms citizens for any reason.we arrived, checked in and made out way to our top floor room. outside the room were 2 empty, used wine glasses - strange. we knocked and no one answered. our key card worked so we went in to find the bed made, but food on the floor and caps to crew top wine bottles. we went back to the desk with intentions of going somewhere else. they asked us to give it another chance with a new room, gave us a $50 credit and free parking (worth $28). we agreed to try another room. the next room was nice and clean. we went to bed around 10 pm that night only to wake up all night to door bells ringing, people talking, doors opening and closing (all night long). we should have called during the night, but thought it wouldn't do much good. the next morning we went to breakfast on the club level floor, which was supposed to open at 6:30 am. we waiting 45 min them to open at 7:15. again, the staff apologized for the delay. when checking out, we shared our concerns and asked for a further credit to compensate for our experience. they said they couldn't do anything further. the manger stayed in his office and didn't even come out to talk to us, but instead let the front desk man handle it. we were very polite and calm when sharing our concerns, knowing it wasn't his fault. we later received an email giving us a free upgrade next time we stay to compensate for our experience. that doesn't do us much good because we wouldn't go there gain.we stayed at this hotel for a retirement party in july. this hotel was very nice and the customer service was great. the doormen would not allow you to wheel your own luggage to your room but with that comes expected tips each time you needed to bring something up from the car.i didn't give the hotel 5 stars for two reasons: 1) the parking is $28/day which i find absurd based on the cost of the rooms. i have an issue with having to pay to park where i have invested my money. 2) when we arrived at our room, we noticed the sheets were crisp but had holes and black marks as if someone had stepped on the sheets. my husband called the front desk, and they came to change the sheets and re-clean the room within an hour.otherwise, the hotel is in walking distance to several shops and eateries. it's shameful that chick-fil-a and starbucks which is up the street is not open on saturdays and sundays.i know one or two things about hotels and level of service expectations....based on my stay this time, the service ranks on par with a holiday inn express. i have stayed at this property a few times and it's rather sad to experience the changes...paying to request wine glasses in room is a first for me at an intercontinental especially at a 35 minutes delivery time. i was even told to go get it at the bar downstairs from 21st floor! my platinum ambassador welcome fruits will probably be mailed to me one of these good days! used to be in the room...lol...no ambassador check in..paying for guest at the club lounge. from paris to asia and every intercontinental i ever stayed around the world this is rude awakening. on a positive note,the property itself is still nice and the rooms are clean. hopefully someone can step up and put things back in order.for me i ll definetely not be coming back. shout out to royce, a staff that tried his best.we used to live in town and moved to the northern suburbs several years ago. the intercontinental has often been our hotel choice when we go in town for dinner. it's sad to say we've just seen the experience go downhill over the years.it's a great location very near our favorite steakhouse (bones) and well situated for a lot of in town activities. the rooms are comfortable and the staff friendly. breakfast is on par with hotels in this class but not a standout. a plus is the awesome bourbon selection and occasionally a great bartender. i must credit a female bartender at the intercontinental buckhead with reviving my interest in a bloody mary a few years ago.that said the bar isn't awesome. there's a smallish area next to the door but the main seating is in the very high ceilinged central room. the high rounded ceiling creates some interesting acoustics. sometimes you will hear a conversation from across the room as if the people are sitting with you.the biggest trend that has pushed us to stay at other hotels is honestly the clientele. during our last visit, there were so many hookers in the lobby my wife and i played a game called hoe or no\" (surprise ending, the hoes win). we've seen the obvious hooker here before but the last time was just over the top. seriously, i don't really have any problem with what people want to do in the privacy of their rooms but in the hotel lobby it‚äôs just a little much. that, combined with the distracted dj playing some type of disco, trance, hip hop, 80s pop mixture that only he enjoyed was just the end for us.i just booked the st. regis for our dinner in a couple of weeks.with the ritz, mandarin and st. regis all nearby it will take a big course correction from intercontinental for us to return.\"this review is not based on a stay - but on my attempts to book at the intercontinental and (lack of) customer service.we normally book with intercontinental in various cities and have ease setting up room and stay preferences with the hotels. there are very specific requirements that we need - and it is usually discussed and ensured before we proceed to book with a new hotel.in attempting to book 6 suites with the atlanta intercontinental (which would have been a new hotel for us), i made two phone calls and sent three emails as directed.phone calls: they would get someone to call back.still waiting... emails sent as directed - no response. even checking tripadvisor and seeing responses from sharon k\" and sending and email for her attention, for which i received proof of delivery - and proof that it was opened/read: no response. (this was over a period of three weeks.)i am grateful i know what there service is like. if this is what you get in attempting a non standard booking heaven knows how atrocious they must be in sorting out a complaint or problem. (most pre-arranged issues for a new hotel include that we always reserve rooms an extra day to ensure that they are cleaned properly before guests arrive the following day - most likely for an early checkin, plus delivery of flowers and specific bathroom amenities for those rooms, to viewing an in-room dining menu as the intercontinental atlanta does not publish theirs - we need to look at dietary preferences / fish or nut allergy - which necessitate being able to book in-room dinners or outside restaurants for the duration of the stay.)want to know what real 5 star service is? it took one phone call to the st regis atlanta and one follow up email to confirm requirements. done. that is 5 star service!\"i've stayed at a intercontinental property before and while at that property (london) i experienced some of the best customer service i've ever seen. so i guess i had unrealistic expectations and i was disappointed.we were not disappointed with the facility itself. the building, it's decor and maintenance were fantastic. in addition it is in a great location near many good restaurants within easy walking distance. rather, our issue was with some staff members and their lack of a genuine desire to help the guest. i got the feeling from multiple staffer that thats not my job\".individually these incidents may seem petty but when you put them together tell a tail of a bad culture. first, due to flight delays we arrived at 1am. as we approached the check-in counter we were observed by a staff member in a suit sitting at at desk. he looked at us and looked back down to his work. there was no one at the counter so we waited several minutes. finally i leaned back to look at the guy behind a desk who again exchanged eye contact but he never made any attempt to call someone to assist. at about that time a front desk clerk came from behind and did check us in.the next morning i went to the restaurant for breakfast. myself and another couple stood at the hostess desk and waited a few minutes until a staff person appeared and we were seated. once at my table i again waited for a server to take my drink order. none came despite seeing three others servers walk by my table, none offering to assist much less greet me.later that morning i was in need of a small amount of ice to put in a zip lock to accompany some medicine i was taking on a field trip. i went to the bar but there was no one there. there were however customers seated in the area with drinks but no one there when i arrived. i walked towards the restaurant and talked to a employee who was behind some kind of meat counter. i asked for some ice and he didn't help nor did he seem to care. i then went to the bell captain desk and a bellman happily helped me get what i needed.on one occasion we went to retrieve our car valet. i went to the car desk where a guy \"in a suit\" was on the phone. i know he is on the phone but he could acknowledge we were there at least. when he completed his call he still did not acknowledge us and took some notes assumingely from the call. i went straight to a bellman who took care of us right away. again, another example of a guy in a suit who is too important to help or even acknowledge a guest.i've saved the best for last. on the morning of our check out my wife was using the bath to put on makeup. i needed the facilities so to spare her i opted to use a bathroom in the lobby. i went down to the closest bath by the elevators. this room has only one stall and it was occupied. i then walked down the hall towards the convention center and found another set of bathrooms. locked! i continued into the convention center area and found a third set of bathrooms. again locked! we are now approaching a critical situation here. i returned to the lobby and told a employee i needed a toilet (this is the best part). he directed me to a man in a suit seated that the a desk near the check-in counter. i repeated my request at which time he told them first guy to go unlock the first bathroom stall for me. apparently they keep the stalls locked! i can only assume they must have a problem with the area homeless. i saw several on the sidewalks and benches surrounding the property. and why, if the first guy i talked to had a key, why did he need to get permission from the man at the desk to unlock a bathroom for a guest? honestly???as i said we've stayed at intercontinental hotels before and received exceptional service. you won't find that here.\"i was charged $7 for a lint roller. the pool was closed by 9pm. good luck finding the parking garage. it wasn't enought to pay $250 for the hotel room for a single night but, you needed to pay $28 to park over night.expedia holds this hotel out as a 5 star. it doesnt come close to a 5 star. i booked a premier king room advanced purchase. ive stayed here a few times and it always takes reception forever to check you in even though you can get right up to the desk. last visit i paid for a king room and because they were running short of kings they gave me a double room and didnt tell me until i gpt to the room. then the front fesk lady who checked me in asked like it was my fault. this is a solid 4 star property but the service definitely lacks in all respects and at most is that of a 3 star.. even the bar area i waited for my food for an hour. if you are truly looking for 5 star stay at ghe st. regis, four seasons or the ritz. ive stayed at all 3 in buckhead and it is like night and day between these properties and the intercontinental. the aesthetic and room comfort are good so if you dont mind bad service then intercontinental is the place to go.this is an exceptional hotel!!! the staff goes above & beyond to make sure your stay is perfect!!! the rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. there is no outside noise from the surrounding area so you get a perfect nights sleep! the property is centrally located with easy access to malls & restaurants. it is definitely my favorite in atlanta!!!!i have stayed here three times and have never had a problem. i reported a stolen item from my room and talked to security. they promised to follow up with me once their investigation was complete, and have not done so. i guess i won't stay here againi honestly don't know where to start. this is a 3.5 star hotel masquerading as a 5 star. they don't belong in the luxury category. i'm actually still here as i type this but i'm just so disappointed in what has turned out to be a dismal birthday weekend. here's a short summary of my experience:despite having a restaurant on the first floor (and hopefully anticipating that not everyone would be able to finish their meals), it was absolutely impossible to get a microwave to my hotel. had to throw away food from southern art, ruth's chris next door, etc.their website does not include a link to the spa where one can browse services/prices, and even make appointments. i've tried to make an appointment for three days. (i'll spare you the sordid tales of incompetence i've encountered). interestingly, they just kept forgetting\" to get back to me. one of the managers (i'm debating whether or not to name him....i'm not trying to get anyone fired) promised to look into it and call me back. it's been almost 24hrs, and i guess he also forgot. i have never gone through so much stress to enjoy myself. at some point, my garage key stopped working, and when i told the front desk, i got a small lecture on how to store card keys. (as someone who used to travel for work, i know not to store them by cell phones and credit cards). this whole experience would be laughable if it wasn't so depressing.what sets a 5 star hotel is supposed to be their level of courtesy, competency, and their ability to anticipate the needs of their guests. you'll get none of that here. just confusion and chaos. this is a 3.5 star, at best. if you really want to enjoy a luxury hotel, go to the st. regis.\"the hotel staff was very friendly, meeting rooms were very nice, and my room was exceptional. the one hitch was that my toilet wouldn't flush. we'll, it did, but nothing was going down. called two consecutive days in a row to report the problem, but it was never truly fixed. had i stayed longer, i would have requested to be moved. not ok to have to use the public facilities. sigh.for our 30th anniversary my husband and i booked a room with a king size bed, which as usual was a bit more expensive than a standard or queen room; however at check in we were told that because i am a spire ambassador we were upgraded\" to a room with two double beds on the concierge/executive floor. the problems with this scenario are that as a spire ambassador i have access to the concierge lounge anyway and we paid extra to ensure we had a king size bed. in what way could this possibly be considered an upgrade? additionally, there was a wedding party at the hotel that completely took over the bar area, which meant guests could not even get the bar tenders attention to order a cocktail. events at hotels are wonderful but the management should be able to plan for extra staff on those occasions so that regular guests can still be treated properly. the final problem was that the fruit and water, standard amenities for spire ambassadors, were not delivered until after 10pm, 2 calls and a trip downstairs to inquire. in short the only service at this property i would say met expectations was the valet who brought our car around when we happily checked out.\"my stay at the intercontinental buckhead was a bit of a disappointment. first off let me say that the room was clean and spacious, the bathroom was very nice and hot water wasn't an issue. i could complain about the bed however, we all know any bed that isn't your bed is never as good. our experience with the staff was mixed. some were very friendly and helpful and others were not. i was very disappointed with what qualified as continental breakfast\" for a hotel of this caliber. we basically received a frittata on day one. the other options were some melon, bagels and some pastries. coffee and juice of course. on day two it was scrambled eggs. the other options were the same and on day 3 a slightly different frittata with the same options. the problem here is that the frittata's contained an item that my wife and i are unable to eat. when we asked if there was another option we received a very snarky response. fortunately some of the other staff were listening and they went around whomever was in charge and were kind enough to bring us some basic scrambled eggs in place of our frittata. the outdoor tent where the complimentary breakfast was held was freezing cold. so not only did you have to come dressed for winter your food would be cold within minutes if you didn't scarf it down. on the last day of our conference which was held at the hotel we were scheduled to finish at 4:00pm however, check out was at 12pm. when asked if it was possible to have a later check out we were denied. my wife had to sit in the lobby for 3 hours with our luggage. the bell hop that helped her to bring the luggage down didn't offer to store the luggage in the \"luggage storage area\" even though that option exists. i've had better breakfast options at other hotels where i paid less than half what i paid per night at this hotel. i would not stay here again based on this experience.\"there were pills laying in the floor of our room at check in. $45 for 2 orders of cold chicken tenders(room service) staff was nice but not knowledgeable. walls paper thin heard everything around us and bed was hard as a rockhad a great stay at the intercontinental buckhead. service was exceptional-from the bellmen to the check in and the wait staff. in town to enjoy the peach bowl and new years. busy time at the hotel and staff was nothing but gracious. loved the bourbon bar!expected more from ihg.good things first: excellent location; self parking is a plus though it cost $28/day; free wifi; has shuttle service to nearby malls; nice bathroom with separate tub and showerbad things next: checked into room and one of the bath towels had a lipstick stain-thought the towels were supposed to be fresh and clean; room service cleaned room but took out the coffee mugs and didn't leave new ones-woke up in morning to make coffee but no mugs or cups available; room service didn't get to clean room until 430pm( used to room service coming between 11 and 3pm); had two rooms booked and room service didn't even come to clean the other room.lastly carefully review bill as they try to add on extra charges. stayed away completely from snack bar but on the final bill there were charges from the snack bar. when i called they said  items had been moved in the snack bar and the charges were automatic\".\"my husband and 2 children ages 11 and 9 had a difficult time accommodating sleeping arrangements as the bed were smaller than queens..they were 2 double beds which is standard but we had to make a bed out of 2 lounge chairs for my daughter. also the bathrooms toilet shower, sink, and tub were all together without any doors which was difficult to get any privacy.overall the hotel is very nice and the staff is friendly. however, when the bedside clock radio goes off at 6am and i wasn't the one that set the alarm, it's rather annoying. one of the lights in the bathroom didn't work, and the water pressure in the shower is fairly low. the service in the restaurant is also extremely slow, even when it is almost empty.very expensive hotel, room not serviced first day despite me being out of the room for 12 hours. repeated calls to front desk promising follow-up on room not being cleaned. mini-bars not restocked from sunday to thursday when i finally got fed up with lack of service, care, and failure of service recovery. finally received a call from a manager on thursday evening after opting to fill out a trip advisor survey. gave me one night in room free and waived mini-bar as attempt to address service recovery failure. accepted gesture but do not believe these folks care about me or my business. i get better service at one star marriott properties when i stay there. would not recommend this hotel to anyone.loved the entire facility this past weekend. however, the service at the restaurant was horribly slow! the server seemed to not understand english well. he made mistakes with our orders, we had to wait a long time for food, and he completely forgot one person's main course. also when we checked in on sat am, the man at registration was surly.i knew the property was fairly full, but never felt like i was in a crowd. i felt like the quality and quiet competence speaks for itself without drawing attention. my stay was a brief overnight, and i believe this will be my choice for future trips. well done.pros- beautiful hotel, great check in experience, friendly staff.cons- 2 hour wait and 3 phone calls for luggage from bellman to be deliveredno comforter or blanket on bed. sheet-like bedspread and cheap blanket in closet.1 hour wait for extra blanket and 2 phone calls for it to be delivered.slow service in hotel barno complimentary water in room.pump bottles in shower didn't dispense product so no shampoo or shower gel available for shower.we have stayed in many hotels in the buckhead area and this was by far our least favorite.first time ever staying at an intercontinental and pretty sure i'll go back to sticking with the ritz.check-in ok. when i asked for an available upgrade i was promptly told fhr amex only permits 1 level upgrade which in our case would be a higher floor. this was even after explaining our sitter cancelled turning our couple getaway into an impromptu family staycation. we were offered a suite for $120 more and went ahead to pay the difference.getting on the elevator we were immediately overcome with weed smell, which is surprising given the price point of the hotel. after checking into our room we went to the pool. there was no attendant during the entire time we were there which again is surprising given the price point of the hotel.our room was ok, but the hairs in the tub and stained pillow (see photos) are not what i'd expect from a high end hotel.while at dinner my husband asked the front desk to ensure the room was turned down so we could put our kiddos to bed and enjoy couples time right after dinner.1.5 hours later we return to the room and...nothing has been done. here we are almost 9pm with a cranky toddler and crying baby waiting for turndown service.not impressed.staff spot on and hotel is very clean. bourbon bar da bomb! location with many fine restaurants within walking distance. metro rail two blocks away to whisk you away to airport. cab fares decent to get you into downtown dining.i had a conference held at the hotel and had reservations made months in advanced. due to airlines travel with 8 hours on a plane i arrived at the intercontinental and tried to check-in. because of my flight i had arrived early in the morning at 7:30am and dean at the front desk informed me that there would be an early charge of $75 if i checked in before 11am. i was ok with paying the additional charge but he said there was no rooms available. i was informed to check in my luggage and wait in the lobby until 11am until a room was available and they would call me. naturally i tried waiting patiently but after an 8 hour plus flight i began to feel sleepy sitting on the couches. by 10:30am...3 hours later!! a security guard named gus woke me up and said that i could not be in the lobby and sleep. i explained to him my predicament and then finally a room now magically\" became available. if it wasn't for gus i would give the intercontinental zero stars. 3 hours of waiting in the lobby and 30mins before 11:00am...i better not get charged $75!!\"really disappointing experience at the intercontinental - it says 'intercontinental' on the outside, but feels like a holiday inn guest experience inside - not surprising, they are sister brands. from a front desk clerk who really couldn't have cared less they didn't have the room type i'd booked (i booked a king, they only had doubles - not the end of the world, but an apology would have been nice) to a doorman who literally let the door go in my colleagues face to jump to run get the door for the mayor who was attending an event and already had an entourage, the hotel left me feeling they would rather i wasn't there... noted. i won't stay at the intercontinental again, and suggest you try one of the many other great hotels in bulkhead - you have a lot to choose from!!normally a super hotel but not so great this weekend. no maid service on sunday. low water pressure in shower. uncomfortable bed ( sheets don't fit bed - short). ac won't cool room properly. have enjoyed this hotel past visits but will go elsewhere in future. perhaps westin or ritz in buckhead. too many to choose from. very good staff and great room service although $$. paid $75 for 2 pecan pie w/ ice cream and 1 coke ?maybe i was expecting too much....the hotel is in the heart of buckhead, and based on face value its pretty. we were here for our anniversary weekend. we stayed one night and found a hilton. the staff didn't even ask why we left early. so disappointed! the best part about the hotel is the proximity to southern art and bourbon bar.i recently stayed at the intercontinental in buckhead for a work conference. overall, the hotel was good. however, my only complaint was house keeping. i was at my conference from 730am-5pm. when i was done for the day, i expected to come back to a clean room. this was not the case. my room did not get cleaned all three days until around 6pm. i would have to leave my room in order for it to be cleaned or have a dirty room the rest of the night. considering i was gone for most of the day and the price the hotel cost per night, i found this totally unacceptable. this hotel needs to hire more staff, so rooms can be cleaned in a timely matter.the hotel is in a great location close to lenox square with large rooms and a good gym.but there are many challenges for this property - all related to the software of the hotel.the breakfast buffet was not very impressive. simple and expensive. sliced bread from the supermarket, cheese spread in plastic containers and a very limited range of food compare to other luxury hotels.i had to call the reception to make them make up my room as until 3pm nothing was done.the fitness center is good and has plenty of options and space.room service is ridiculous. takes 45 minutes to make a caesar salad. not very impressed. so i declined. trying again the day after, i ordered an omelette, soft cooked/medium. the one i got was hard as a rock. the day after i tried again, same result. to add to the insult, the waiter forgot the fork so i had to eat the omelette with my hands. called for a fork but none arrived and the omelette went cold. this is not acceptable for a hotel that calls itself an intercon. to make it complete they add automatically 21% service charge and want a tip on top. for that amount of money you should be able to check that the customer gets a fork and knife and maybe deliver it in time.the internet was a mess. nobody in the reception knew anything about it so i had to talk to a it help desk since the webpage was faulty. not impressed with this either.the instant service call s not anything instant. takes a loooong time to answer, if at all. sometimes i had to hang up and try again 30 minutes later. not sure what they imply with instant service but it has improvement potential.the in-house restaurant has a limited menu to choose from. i tried a club sandwich that was ok - nothing special. a good hotel in my book always makes great club sandwiches and omelets. intercon didn't score too well on the either.overall a very disappointing stay. intercon should know how to perform better than this. if this is the model they want to apply in atlanta, they will struggle long term.hotel is well set to be a nice property with good service, but management needs to work on the softer side of the service delivery model to make this a hotel that deserves it name/standingi have stayed at the intercontinental many times over the years and feel that the quality is not quite up to par with how it once was. my mom's sheets had a hole in them, the makeup light was not working, there was no lotion with the toiletries and a serious lack of wash cloths. not at all what you would expect. by the time we noticed all of these issues it was too late to remedy them. it also didn't help that the people in the next room came in at 1:30 and were insanely noisy.nice, clean, large rooms. hotel located in buckhead, which is a great because you're close to shopping & restaurants. you can walk just about everywhere you need to go. i haven't been on the marta in a very long time so i cannot recommend the public transportation but, there was a stop very close to the hotel. we were with a large group and reserved 5 rooms which were not all ready when we checked in at 7p.m. that's my only complaint.let me be upfront and tell you that this is a review based on my wife's stay in this property and my hassle with the staff. she just returned from a business conference hosted by the intercontinental buckhead and spent three nights in the hotel. unfortunately she was away from home for her birthday so i arranged for gourmet cupcakes to be delivered to her room on her birthday. flowers would have been the normal choice but two dozen roses won't fit through the x-ray machine at the airport.the kupcakerie of atlanta did a masterful job and making special treats to order and delivered to the hotel concierge around noon. my wife checked her room around 1pm and it was undisturbed (she suspected that i might do something special.) after four more hours of conferences, she again returned to the room to prepare for the evening group work.... still nothing... no messages... no notes.... and no thoughtful gift.as 6pm approached and she was about to head out for the evening, she called me to talk about the day and convinced that no one had given a rip about her birthday or having to work through it. after 10 min. of catching up and just before we hung up, i asked if she had gotten anything. nothing! no messages... no note... no gift... and as she was headed out the door she asked a member of the turn-down staff if there was something waiting at the front desk for her room. nothing!i was ready to rip someone's head off and immediately called the vendor. at nearly 6pm they were still open and quickly related how they had given the gift to the hotel concierge... i may have been talking to the actual delivery guy. henry\" from the bakery was so upset on my behalf that he e-mailed me at the end of his shift just to make sure things had been resolved.i called the intercontinental and talked to a well meaning staff member. she was polite and when i explained what was going on her words were \"oh yeah, i remember seeing an email about cupcakes...\" therein is the motivation for this review. hotels deal with flower and gift deliveries all the time, especially ones like the ic that try to convey 4-star service. in this case no one... and i assume that many read the email... had the common sense to take a little box of delivered cupcakes to the guest's room. seriously.... five hours of sitting around.... no attempt to contact the guest.... is the concierge part-time?apologies were offered after a pointed conversation and a $4.99 bottle of champagne was delivered with the gift... insult to injury. this was definite one-star service.beyond the poor service was a very limited menu at the hotel restaurants and what food my wife did order was of steak -n- shake caliber. the rooms were clean and she did express how beautiful the property was. it appears that the hotel caters to working guests that just need a good bed and well stocked bar.atlanta is a fun place to visit with a wide variety of restaurant and venues to check out. we will not step foot on this property again.\"hotel is similar to other moderate to upscale hotels in buckhead. i have stayed here probably fifteen times in years past. most of the staff is very friendly and helpful. however, the young man checking us in, justin, was so snooty and rude that i doubt we will ever choose to stay here again.the location is very good, in the centre of buckhead area. what in my opinion is terrible is the service that you get, especially from the housekeeping. i arrived very tired in the late afternoon and once i opened the wardrobe i found a kid sock (i suppose left from a previous guest), i was so tired that i decided to overlook this detail. unfortunately, a few minutes after i used the bathroom and the w.c. had clear traces from the previous guests. it was clear that the room cleaning was not done properly and nobody had checked my room before the arrival.i called the guest relations manager to complain about this very unpleasant situation and asking to have somebody from the hotel management to meet me and see how i found my room. the guest relation manager and the housekeeping manager after a few minutes arrived and, once i showed them my room, they apologized and sent to my room a maid to clean again the bathroom. since i was about to order dinner via room service, the guest relations manager said that this would have been provided with their compliments.also in the following days, i realized that my room was not properly cleaned :- after two days, i had to phone housekeeping because bodywash was not provided (since the first day i was only provided with shampoo‚ä¶)- when i tried to use the hairdryer, the handle was dirty and sticky (i had to use a napkin to handle it): i left it on the desk believing that the maid would have realized it was nasty and replaced it, but unfortunately it didn‚äôt happen: i had to phone the concierge and ask to have it replaced.even if i stayed there for three nights, i was never contacted again by the guest relations manager of the hotel management to check if everything was fine after the disastrous conditions my room was on arrival and also at check-out nobody asked whether i enjoyed my stay. it simply looks like nobody at the hotel cares whether the guests are enjoying their stay or not.i‚äôve stayed before in many intercontinental, but this is definitely the worst....you enjoy being greeted by semi-informed and relatively ineffective front desk staff as they describe why they've given your full-price room away due to a misunderstanding.\" if that's your cup of tea, then this is your hotel. if not, you would do better at the four seasons, or even the nearby embassy suites.\"we stayed here on our wedding night (jan 31st) and i still can't shake the feeling of poor service. my new wife and i arrived to check into the hotel and one of the front desk staff was sitting on the sofa in front of the desk talking to a friend i suppose while we waited for the other agent to finish up. after going through an average check in we went to the bellstand to be escorted up when the bellmen told us he would be up shortly it's my wedding night i don't want the bags to come up on your time and especially when there was nothing else going on. we then head up to the room without the bags and bellmen and the keys don't work. we then walk back down to the desk and get new keys and they don't work again, the bellmen then meets us at the room and let's us in he then says he will send security up to look at the lock. i kindly decline and say i will get keys on the way out of the room. 10 min later we get a call asking if they can send someone up i kindly decline again. we then got back to the hotel after going out and obtained new keys and they told us the lock had to be reprogrammed. all in all everyone in the front office operation just seems scattered and acts like things aren't that big of an issue and offer little to no resolve. i am sad that this happened on my wedding night and i will never get that experience back.i booked this hotel without any prior knowledge for a bachelorette weekend. the staff was amazing. especially the concierge roosevelt. i had a mishap with a package sent there and roosevelt and his manager were very apologetic and sent champagne and delicious cake to the room. roosevelt called ahead of our brunch reservation and got us red carpet treatment. he was a joy to talk to and work with and because of him i will be an intercontinental client from now on. we also ate at the restaurant there and the steak was fantastic. also the location is fantastic!based on the reputation of the ihg brand as well as reviews, we booked our stay for our family stay-cation. there were a couple issues we encountered: the primary issue was the beds were extremely hard and uncomfortable; our mini fridge/bar was empty and didn't work. thus, we could cool water we purchased. lastly, the service was not very good. we had to call twice for extra towels, which seems to be a simple request.we did encounter some positives: the breakfast buffet has great variety for the spend and is delicious; the location is convenient to a number restaurants, malls and marta station.overall, for us the negatives outweighed the positives and we wouldn't stay here again.i have stayed at the intercontinental without my dog and had a very nice experience, but when we brought our pet with us on our last trip we were shocked by the waiver that we were asked to sign. we were told that we must be with our dog (a 12 pound poodle) at all times during our stay. we could not go to church for easter and leave our poodle in the room, she could not stay alone in the room under any circumstances. we were told if they discovered that our pet was alone in the room we would be evicted from the hotel. how can they call themselves a pet friendly hotel with rules like that?thankfully they gave us a full refund, and we moved to a much friendlier pet hotel, the four seasons, where our dog was treated like a vip!my husband and i stayed there in march of 2016. we were using our free nights' from the ihg credit card. the hotel is beautiful. it must have been recently redone. the d√©cor was quite stunning.but that's where the good stuff stopped. the service was nonexistent. no matter what we tried to accomplish, the answer was no. even when it was \"yes,\" it never made it into the computer for the next front desk person to know we had been granted a small favor.our room was not cleaned for the entire day, even though we complained 4 times. the staff was very apologetic, and granted us access to the lounge at 10 at night, while the room was supposedly being cleaned. of course the key to the lounge didn't work. this is just one example of our continuing frustration with this property.i would like to give a shout out to the gentleman in the lounge. he was great, and even gave us a bottle of wine to take back to the room. also, the door men were very good.there are so many properties to stay at in buckhead, that i don't see any reason to come back to this one.\"amazing hotel with a caring staff (candis), lovely rooms, great food, and a relaxing spa. the place is intimate and attracts an upscale crowd. excellent choice! try it once and you will never stay at another buckhead hotel again.in the midst of great restaurants - rooms are really nice - service amazing!!!! and... the lobby has a ham and bourbon bar - oh my word!!!!!!!! locally sourced cured hand with amazing cheeses - you have to try this place when you stay here!!!!! wifi is great in rooms and all through hotel!love staying here!as an ihg platinum ambassador and hilton honors gold, i actually prefer to stay in ihg hotels in most cities. we were celebrating my husbands 50th birthday (which i planned) so i was hoping that everything would turn out well. had previously arranged to have cake in the room upon arrival and it was there with happy birthday and his name written on the plate. there were 3 of us so they were nice enough to leave two small cakes rather than the one they usually provide. we booked the king ambassador suite which is absolutely beautiful. prior to booking it was difficult to get a visual of the room or a very good description other than the fact it is over 1400 sq. ft. the room has 4 sinks (3 in the very large main bathroom) 2 couches, 2 chairs and 2 tv's. there is a half bath which is very convenient, as it is just off the large entry way. a rollaway bed is available as this particular suite has no sofa bed and there is a huge walk in closet as well as a smaller closet that housed an ironing board and iron. the club lounge was nice but not great, in my opinion.now for the negative. i had already called our driver and i had my husband go to check out, asking him to get a receipt, as i was making sure we weren't charged something from the mini bar, etc. (has happened to me in the past at another ic). i was shocked to see charges to our room for drinks from the bar and food from the restaurant, southern art. we ate at the restaurant and paid cash, and did not have drinks from the bar at all. long story short, a lengthy, unpleasant discussion took place, causing our driver to have to wait (me feeling obligated to give him a larger tip than normal for his delay) and my husband ending what had been a great birthday on a sour note. our concern is that someone could just give our room number and charge numerous items without any type of id required, or the room number was entered in error, we aren't sure, but either way it was a little unsettling. this alone wouldn't keep me from recommending the hotel, but definitely check your bill.bulkhead -- if you're going -- or returning -- you know there are countless fine hotel properties within walking distance of one another. the intercontinental -- holds its own and them some. first -- the hotel is fairly new, by comparison to many of the other properties -- and the property is first rate -- the room i had -- was on a higher floor, king bed as comfy as any hotel ever -- giant tv -- very nice appointments and bathroom quite clean, modern and amenities top rate. you could, on a very nice day - walk to many office buildings and two large malls -- or some top notch restaurants -- or -- take the metro into mid-town or downtown, even the airport. but why -- the hotel runs a shuttle to locations within two miles -- and that covers all of bulkhead.you should know that properties are made special by the quality of the staff and services. this intercontinental stood out, even in highly competitive bulkhead, with exceptionally friendly staff -- always near to lend a hand -- inquire as to the quality of your stay and how they could make it better. of special note - and by example, is one samuel huff -- whose business card is transportation service. this individual went out of his way to provide exceptional service, was most helpful with local issues, knew the area, helped with luggage, was always on call for pick-up and in a most professional way -- would extol the virtues and benefits of working at the intercontinental -- and why it is a special place for him and their quests. he exemplifies first rate service. the rest of the staff from front desk to valets also represent the hotel well.only issue -- was getting room key to work - and wake-up call didn't happen one morning. considering the amount of travel i do and the many hotels were staff were not to this exceptional level ... a non issue at the end of the day. the intercontinental was a pleasant surprise in an area i thought i knew well -- and clearly -- one of the best hotels to consider in bulkhead.we chose this hotel for its ratings. located about 25 min. north of downtown. the disappointing parts are:1: $24 just to park in the self parking garage. $34 if you let them park it for you.2. $10 to use the internet so prepare to use your cell phone hotspot.3. $$$ expensive eating. we got in around midnight. the only place to get food in the area is the hotel which at that hour has to be room service. the turkey club said $18 on the menu but the bill came to $28 bucks. i hate forced tipping of 21%. $3.50 just to bring it to your room.cleanliness...not so much. it seems that if the head of the vacuum cleaner didn't fit, it didn't get vacuumed. looking for plugs behind chairs and such showed years of dust layers. when the sun shown throw the curtains in the morning, looked like an a solid layer of dust under the night stand.no complimentary bottled water, very expensive. cheaper at a movie theater. but the water from the sink was good.on the 6th floor, room 620, give the shower a full 10 minutes running before you can use it.now if staying in high rise hotels has all of these experiences as common, then disregard. i'm used to holiday inn express, great beds, free water, clean rooms.stayed mid week at the intercontinental for a family reunion. a few items- food was very average and very expensive. cold egg whites for breakfast. runny oatmeal. lobby bar is packed in the evening, but very spread out and servers have a hard time getting to everyone. took our group about 30 minutes to get drinks. no blanton's at the bourbon bar. my husband was so sad. ;) restaurant and lobby decor is weird.room was fine, a bit small- we had a standard king room. nothing special. nice view of stone mountain. nice big towels and large soaker tub. coffee maker in bathroom which was kind of weird. no mini bar or fridge in the room. barking dog in room next to us. barked during the day so not really an issue, but still a bit of a bother. parking is $35 per day- $24 to self park and internet is $10. no water bottles in the room and smallest bottle in the guest shop was $3.23! really annoying to see these crazy charges.fine for business, but for romance go down the street to the ritz carlton.i feel as though the intercontinental was once a great luxury hotel. that really isn't the case any longer. while there were definitely some great elements (the food!), there were several key elements that were not to par. check-in was fast and efficient.when i got to my room, i wanted to take a nice shower before bed. that is where the problems started. i put the shower on a pretty warm temperature, but as i was in the shower, the temperature varied greatly. it got cool then burning inferno then cool, then for a brief and beautiful second it was the perfect temperature. i gave up on the shower, got out and hopped into the beautiful oversized bed. i noticed that the bed was a bit uncomfortable because it felt like something was on the sheets poking me. i tried dusting off the bed, thinking it was something i brought into bed with me, but that didnt help. as i tried to get settled into the bed, it actually got worse. i got the flashlight on my phone and realized that it was actually feathers from the mattress. what should have been comfortable was certainly not because the sheets were not thick enough to keep them from coming through. i also had a terrible time with the remote. they have replaced the tv brand remote with a generic version and it took an act of congress and standing on my head to change the channel.additionally, on my second night there, i happened to be in the room when it was time for turn down service. housekeeping came through and rang the doorbell literally 18 times while knocking and screaming. i was trying to make it to the door, but apparently i wasn't going fast enough.overall, the appearance of the hotel is okay unless you start looking closely at things. the furniture was very dented and dinged. the couches in the common area were ridiculously filthy along the edges and corners. the decor was a little dated. the walls in my room were a very interesting shade of peachy/orange. the bell hop stand had a vase with the crazy little hot pink/purple rocks from the nineties and some dusty artificial flowers.while my check-in experience was great, my checkout experience was not as friendly. i told the lady at the desk that i needed a receipt printed out. she asked if i needed parking. i told her that i did not because i had taken care of that upon check-in. i then asked if i needed to renew my parking for another day since i would be staying past my check out time for a conference in the hotel. the lady literally said, what parking? you said you didn't need no parking.\" when i explained it for a second time, she answered with \"i guess you gon get out.\"on a high note, however, i had dinner at southern art and it was absolutely beautiful. the biscuits they brought out were absolutely divine. the shrimp and grits were so good, and the cappuccino was quite perfect.\"i did a surprise\" deal with expedia for a 5-star hotel in buckhead, atlanta, ga for a romantice birthday weekend.it was not a good surprise. when i saw the hotel was the intercontinental, i objected and called expedia to see if i could cancel.the representative said that although the deal was not refundable, often the hotel will allow a cancellation. they put me on hold to call the hotel. sorry, no can do. i decided to give the hotel a chance.1. at 10:20 pm, there was a band in the lobby playing very loud music. it was difficult to hear the clerks at the reception desk.2. there was a line of a dozen people trying to check in. i waited in line for 15 minutes.3. i asked if there were any suites available, i was told there were none available.4. i was offered a club level room for an additional $80 per night. no, thank you.5. the elevator had a ritz cracker on the corner of the floor. disgusting.6. the room had two double beds, apparently this was the request on the reservation. this was a miscommunication from expedia, because the \"surprise\" deal did not allow a bed request.7. the coffee machine and tray were in the bathroom, four feet from the toilet, with no door in between.8. the manager did not return my message. i called back the next day. i was told there was a king room available for an additional charge of $30. we only needed to pack our bags, and take them back to the reception desk. after my objection, the manager (brad or mr. bradley) offered to waive the $30 fee.instead, i made a reservation for the rest of the weekend at the four seasons. that saved the weekend.after speaking with the manager again at check-out, they agreed to refund my second night stay.\"we checked into the intercontinental for a night away. we were expecting a 5 star hotel which meant not only excellent service but high quality rooms. when we first checked in, it was great. the front desk staff was nice and helpful. they signed us up for ihg rewards and let us know about all of the benefits. my wife and i went out for the early evening for dinner and returned to the hotel and called down for 2 pairs of slippers. when someone finally came (it took a long time) they rang the bell and began banging on the door. at which point they only brought up 1 pair. we waited again for another pair and when it was finally brought up a tip was given, but was implied that it was not enough. that was quite annoying. the bed in the room was very uncomfortable. i woke up throughout the night with back pain and there was a dip in the bed. i had to try and find different positions to sleep so my back would not hurt. i woke up with back pain that lasted through the morning. we were expecting a high quality bed for the type of hotel it is supposed to be.we are not considering staying here again.romantic weekend with great papered service! jazz band, bourbon bar, awesome food and excellent service at every level. especially enjoyed breakfast at southern art was the best i have ever had in a hotel. enjoy the !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!the hotel lobby and service personnel are great, but where it counts, the room, i had an issue with the sounds (noise). we where about 10 rooms away from the elevator but it could still be heard every time it went up or down. if the next door room guest blowed his nose you where forced to say bless you as it was just like he was next to you. oh yea, the mattress had a valley in the middle and hard. this is no 4 star hotel.i really wanted to give this hotel 5 stars but couldn't. i'm still checked in but couldn't wait to leave this review because im so unhappy.i picked this hotel because it had all of the amenities that i needed. i have special dietary requirements so upon arrival i requested a microwave and a refrigerator. $80....ok. the first refrigerator went out, taking my meals almost down to room temp. i requested a second refrigerator that started and did the same. the employee came and dragged it out by the cord (hmmm, could that be why it doesn't work???). the next refrigerator did the same so i requested another. the employee that brought it said that he'd have to immediately take the non working fridge. i told him that once the new fridge was up and cool so that i could transfer my cooling meals he could come back and get it. after a verbal exchange (which should have never happened) a supervisor was sent to my room who allowed me to keep the fridge.our third night (tonight) it's after 6pm and our room still has not been cleaned.on my next visit i'll stay at another location where hopefully the staff is friendlier and the housekeeping staff cleans everyday!!!this hotel is very expensive. that's not my beef. i paid more so i definitely expected a higher quality of service!!!it's an intercontinental. first class all the way. many famous people stay at this hotel when in atlanta. no complaints. location is at the heart of buckhead; so five star dining, shopping, etc is minutes away.expect a hefty parking expense, this is atlanta so don't plan for public transportation.don't check into this hotel if you are allergic to feathers! they are completely in prepared for it and you will wait for hours after check in, as you watch everyone else check in behind you. looking around now after hours of waiting, the lobby is empty and huge. almost vacant while we sit here waiting less than patiently.my best friend and i stayed here for a girls trip and we loved every second of it. the hotel itself is gorgeous, the rooms are spacious and provide more than enough room for all! we loved the location!!!! it is right in the heart of buckhead and literally it was a 6 dollar uber ride anywhere and everywhere we went! there are tons of great restaraunts, shops, bars and cafes within walking distance.as far as the staff goes, we could not have been happier with our experiences!!!! every staff member was helpful, hospitable and happy and gave us great tips and information. our two favorites had to be aaron and jazmin at the hotel bar!!! their customer service was above and beyond anything we could have ever expected!! they took great care of us and made sure we had everything we needed. they provided great tips on things to do in the area and they made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our stay! all we can say is that we hope management will recognize them for their fantastic customer service!!!!!! ps: kyle the night manager was also amazing and took great care of us!!!!all in all, when we chose atlanta as a destination we had no idea where we would stay....but we are so glad that we chose the intercontinental!!!!!!!! we will 100% stay here again and we highly reccomend it to anyone and everyone!the hotel is great. the bathtub and bed are amazing. prior to coming for a conference, i called up the concierge (roosevelt) for restaurant ideas and he sent me several. i picked kyma and roosevelt made a lovely reservation. my clients were delighted with the restaurant. when we got the check we found out that one of the appetizers was bought by roosevelt. what a lovely surprise. thank you roosevelt and intercontinental hotel.after a long day of flight delays and travel challenges, the last thing you want to hear is there's a problem with your reservation\". yet, that was my experience, because my reservation had been made for the wrong night. however, the attentive and thoughtful front desk staff - namely joshua in this case - turned my disappointment into delight. not only did he provide a room when the hotel was at capacity, he upgraded me to the presidential suite. he turned a mistake (on my part) into a memorable experience. this hotel will be my destination of choice when i'm in atlanta and i'd encourage you to make it yours too.\"the guy who checked us in was less than warm and courteous, and we were awakened by a thudding noise that cycled every 3-5 minutes. after several calls and lots of waiting, we were finally moved to another room for our second night's stay--but were given a smaller room and downgraded from a king to a queen bed. overall the experience was less than pleasant. it doesn't matter if you're in a room with both a shower and separate bathtub (the only reason we could determine why this is considered 5-star hotel) if service is poor and the staff unfriendly. we'll never stay here again....the night before a business meeting i ruined my pants trying to iron them, iron too hot. with no time to spare and a business dinner to go to i went to the front desk and the manager (lacey) didn't hesitate. she simply said i'll take care of it, and boy did she! lacey grabbed a co-worker, willie, went to macey's and bought me a pair of pants (the same size) and put them on my bed so i'd have them for my meeting the next morning.we booked the hotel due to the good ratings and i really do not understand how this hotel made it in the top 5* hotels of atlanta.it is not exceptionally bad, but there are too many disqualifying factors that i am not ready to accept in an upscale hotel:#1: extremely loud rooms: be prepared to get the full sound of a 8 road street, that goes 24h per day, impossible to sleep - and thanks to put a crying baby next to our room. while they have to put it somewhere, as a service conscious hotel i would put it not in a room with connecting doors#2: lack of service whereever you go:a) had booked a king, request high floor, quiet, received twin floor 4 of 20+ (wife had trusted the hotel, so went back to get the street-race+baby-cry-roomb) card for car park did not work (also for other cars before us), rude reply from service, no apologiesc) when self parking, you realize that the best places are reserved for valet - that's a great sign for me how the hotel rates customer service: rather have the personnel get the better places and let the guests do a little tour in the garage...d) room not made at 5pme) breakfast room layout worst i have seen in years: people queuing for eggs etc. are blocking the tiny space with the buffet, had been there very late, still waited 20 min in line for waffles - must feel like a battle field at prime time....do not think this is a typical european rating of people that do not like big hotels - we are pro american, i work for an american company, spending +200 nights in 5* hotels, e.g. park hyattcheck-in was smooth & easy & the staff was incredible! the room was beautiful & had a great view of the city. the restaurant in the hotel was very good, although it wasn't the most gluten-free-friendly of restaurants. our group left the hotel for dinner & an offsite course & the shuttle service was fantastic, prompt, & perfect for our needs. the wifi didn't work so well. overall, great hotel!this pretty hotel is unfortunate to have terrible service. at check in, rooms were not available until over an hour past check in. when the room was ready, i was supposed to get a call but never did. during check in, the counter person left without reason for at least 5 minutes saying only excuse me\" while i stood waiting and wondering if he would return. once i finally got a room, it was a nice clean room. i did not get a privacy tag and had to use a piece of paper shoved in the door. after one night, housekeeping removed all drinking glasses from my room and never gave me any replacements. they also left pillows stacked on the floor - not making the bed. the complimentary lotion was a partially used bottle. the hotel charged my credit card a mysterious $100 a night incidental fee without ever telling me this would occur. i thought someone had stolen my card. when i asked for glasses for my room, i received tea cups at my door. the hostess at the restaurant was rude and unsmiling. and many more little red marks. just a cluster of disorganization in a nice hotel. i would not recommend it to anyone.\"i stayed here recently for a wedding. i knew nothing about the property when we booked it so i took to tripadvisor to see the reviews that it got. there were some great reviews and i was looking forward to checking in. my happiness quickly dissapaited at check in. a lady named candice checked me in and she was one of the most rude people i have ever encountered at a hotel. she seemed to be trying to ignore the line of people waiting to check in and then she acted as though i was bothering her by standing at her desk. she talked so fast i could not understand half the things she told me about the property or my reservation (for instance, how expensive the parking was) and did not have a professional demeanor at all. i left the check in desk feeling completely underwhelmed by the hotel. luckily our room was lovely and the rest of the staff i encountered (like the gentleman that checked me out, i wish i remembered his name) were very friendly so it seems as though candice is the exception to the rule.upon returning home i was looking through the reviews on here again and it seems as though candice gets a lot of glowing reviews. i'm not sure why my experience was so different? are those reviews real? is she paying people to write wonderful things about her? i hope that another guest doesn't get the same first impression of such a nice hotel that i did.my wife was so pleased. candis made our stay amazing. the customer service i received was outstanding.... i will stay at this hotel everytime i visit buckhead just because of candis. thank you candis see you soon.room was amazing comfortable and highest quality . loved the hospitality of the concierge lounge staff was amazing here too...if it wouldn't be for the rude and unhelpful valet parking guys. it would have been the perfect hotel. thank you again intercontinental!the place was plenty nice, but be aware that the internet is very slow. i checked with a speed test, and it is basically dial up speed. web pages take a minute to load, and forget about video or doing any business involving downloading files.if you plan on using the wi-fi, you'd be better served going somewhere else.i recently stayed on business at the intercontinental buckhead. my work was all within the hotel so i did not have the opportunity to go out and sample atlanta's many fine restaurants and relied on room service most nights. unfortunately the service\" was less than satisfactory. when i checked out i expressed my concerns to the front desk, they listened and discounted my bill. that same day i received an email from the room service manager asking me for additional feedback. i wrote back and they listened. they went out of their way to make things right. what would have been a negative review has turned into a positive one. i would return to this hotel because the staff listens and responds to their guests. they don't sit on their hands, they take action. this speaks volumes in today's marketplace.\"first let me start positive, this is an amazing hotel, the bed is wonderful, the bathroom is amazing, the restaurant had very good service. especially for a holiday evening.however,we stayed christmas eve, as we were passing through, since we would be traveling i called 5 days before and asked if it would be possible to get cookie and milk to leave out for santa for our son. i was told by the front desk, it would be no problem. i asked at the front desk would cookie and milk for santa be an issue? once again ..no problem, just call down and it will be taken care of...you know where this is going.... about 9 pm its bed time, i call down ...the in room dine anytime tells me ...sorry we don't do that, we don't have cookies and milk, unless there is some special event.now santa still came by and left a stocking, but the concerned look on my son's face when he went to bed and he did not have anything to leave out for santa will stay with me for a very long time.the next morning i talk to the front desk to express my unhappiness, i talk to the front desk manager, jason. i get ...i'm sorry to hear that\", \" i hate that happened\", lots of words, but no actions.i didn't want him to comp me anything, i didn't ask for anything, but when a hotel claims their service is the best, and prides themselves on customer service, and i even call ahead to confirm, i felt like the ball was dropped, and when i complain to someone in authority, just simple apologies didn't and couldn't fix it.the hotel was beautiful, and the location was amazing, the amenities are top notch. but the very poor customer service left a lot to be desired\"i would like to say perfect views of the city on one side and the stone mountain view from the other side. bed is super comfy and the bathroom is quite lovely and big. nice deep tub that my wife simply enjoyed. all areas of the hotel is just simply beautiful. visited the southern art bourbon bar and had a blast. everyone of their staff is very friendly.very comfortable bed. spotless clean.my husband and i were reconsidering staying here for another trip but because of the experience we had 2-3 weeks we are considering staying elsewhere. we had access to the club lounge but none of our keys would function on the elevator. i called front desk to report it, no one arrived. i continues calling the front desk and once i couldn't get in touch with them i proceeded to ask the male attendant that was available. as i approached him, there was a strong stinch of alcohol on his breath. he could not function and speak clear of his words. i tried complaining but there was no one to complain to so i felt the need to write this review since i was told there wasn't a manager assigned to the area.the rooms-the beds are comfy and the bathroom is like heaven. i soaked in the tub both nights we were there. our two negatives are that the walls are incredibly thin and the bourbon bar was a big disappointment. the bar looked inviting and we went in for a drink around 9:00 pm but the service was slow and surly.dow / joneswe had a wonderful stay because of one of your outstanding front desk staff members candis\" overcame our concerns. candis understands that expectations are everything and when they are not met it can tarnish your stay. candis adds true value to you staff. thank you candis\"all areas of the hotel is just simply beautiful. visited the southern art bourbon bar and had a blast. everyone of their staff is very friendly bed is super comfy and the bathroom is quite lovely and big. nice deep tub that my wife simply enjoyed. everything was perfect and clean.the room was extremely clean and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. i used their spa, and the service was great, the massage i recieved was beyond relaxing. if you do the spa, ask for sylvia, she has a lot of experience and is good at what she does. i had a minor issue with the air conditioning in my roomthe rooms-the beds are comfy and the bathroom is like heaven. i soaked in the tub both nights we were there. our two negatives are that the walls are incredibly thin and the bourbon bar was a big disappointment. the bar looked inviting and we went in for a drink around 10:00 pm but the service was slow and surly.we booked online and when we arrived the front desk person suggested an upgrade to our room that had a great view and was a little bit better of a room. we decided it was a good deal.... but when we got to the room there was trash in the cabinet and on the floor, and dried toothpaste on the vanity. we called to inform and let them know how disappointed we were, especially seeing this being rated a 5 star hotel and the money we just spent. the lady on the phone was great, apologized and said she would not charge us the upgrade fee. she also asked if we wanted to be moved to a different room, which we did (who wants to stay in a dirty hotel room). she put us on a club level room for our inconvenience, an upgrade to what we had already upgraded to. we got to our new room and it was much better. nice and clean, bed turned down, everything appeared to be good.since she upgraded us to club level, my wife and i decided we would head up the the club lounge and grab a drink and a small appetizer before we headed out to dinner. we insert out room key in the slot in the elevator and press the club lounge floor.... no dice. not working. we head downstairs to the front desk, inform the front desk clerk, and he apologizes and takes our key somewhere in the back to speak to the lady we spoke with earlier. he came back and issued us 2 new room keys and apologized again for all our inconveniences. it was getting late and we had a reservation at a restaurant, so we did not head back up to the lounge at that time. we did however once we got back, we wanted to get a drink before calling it a night. we walked into the lounge about 1 minute before it closed for the evening. just not having a good night it seems.we did take a drink to take back to our room though.the experience this far was still ok\" because of the fantastic customer service and how they handled a disappointed guest. i still felt they tried and went above and beyond.however, the next morning my wife decided to take a bath in the nice large soaking tub. after she was through though, the water wouldn't drain from the tub. i went downstairs to speak with the manager this time, to let him know of our experience. he apologized, as he was made aware of our experience we had, and offered is a complimentary breakfast due to the continued sub-par experience. i informed him that we were already heading to the club lounge for our complimentary breakfast, and he just said \"oh that's a much better breakfast anyway\". he apologized again for our experience.all in all not worth the money we paid... could have had a bit better experience at a sharaton for less money.\"we'd done a tour of several cities in the south east, and at every one we stayed in 2-3 star hotels as was our budget. these hotels were between ¬£50-¬£90, but i'd done my research, and they were all great for the price.as a treat on our last night i wanted something special, so i looked at the tripadvisdor reviews for some 4-5 star hotels that were good value. this hotel came up at ¬£150, and was 5 star. it was about ¬£50 cheaper than it's nearest rival, so i booked it.on arrival i was very excited, but a little nervous, as all the other guests were dressed smartly in business clothing, where as we were quite casual. i was immediately impressed with our room, and was perfectly happy of what it cost me. due to the good price & room i was already aiming to give it 5 stars on tripadvisor. the only niggles i had were the pillows were too thick for my liking, and the bathrooms scales were broken.now, it was our last night in the us, and we were looking forward to a lie in, but at around 8.15am we were woken by drilling! we couldn't believe what we were hearing, so i immediately called reception. when i told the gentleman on the other end of the phone he wasn't aware that works were going on at this time, and apologised. he obviously assumed that was sufficient, so i replied well what are you going to do about it?\" and he told me he'd get the manager. the manager offered us a late check out, but that was pointless, so asked for complimentary breakfast which was $25 per person. he agreed.this action got the rating back up to 3 stars, but when we went to check out and settle our bill, the breakfast was still being charged. the receptionist i was dealing with looked like we were wasting her time, and was rude. this lost them another star.i would have taken a 2 star hotel over this place any day, but then we are not their typical clients.drilling? in a 5 star hotel in the early morning with no warning? i wonder how one of their regular wealthier/more powerful guests would have reacted?\"stayed in here twice now & if on business again in atlanta would not stay anywhere else. great rooms, good food & a nice bar area so recommend it to anyone looking for a good hotel. the rooms both times have been first class & very quiet & the club floor lounge is just perfect to relax in & have a coffee or two.stayed here for 2 nights. hotel is in a good location, close to marta station and the lenox square mall.large roooms with really comfy beds. bathtub is absolutely huge!extortionate price of room service and painfully slow/disorganised service at the bourbon bar are the only things that stop this place getting a 5* rating from me.from the very beginning it was underwhelming, at best. as i arrived at the valet area, i was not greeted nor acknowledge in any way. the check in process was long but pleasant, but even that glimmer of hope faded as i found that my room had a worn desk, floor lamp blown, and dirt/mud on glasses by the bathroom sink. noticing the sign that said anything in the fridge/minibar that was removed would automatically be charged to my room, i called the front desk to make them aware that i needed a fridge for food that i had brought with me. they said i could remove some items to make room for my food, but if would be charged because even canned drinks can be spoiled if not kept cool in a fridge. are you kidding me?! i then asked if i could have a fridge brought up. this would be possible but there would be a $50 charge for it. after expressing my dissatisfaction with the inhospitality, the girl at the front desk expressed her indifference - even after i asked if this is the reputation she wants broadcasted over tripadvisor. all in all what was supposed to be a romantic reunion with my partner who has been out of the country for 5 months was just an expensive hassle. we would not recommend this intercontenental to anyone.don't eat at the hotel, the room service menu is very, very low quality and expensive. this made my stay at this hotel a bad experience. everything was going fine since we check in, then i ordered a turkey sandwich\" (2 slices of ham, one cheese slice, a tomato slice and 4 pices of little pickles) and a seafood gumbo soup (with meat???????!...aagh!!!) and a beer that added up to a $58.00 bill.\"this is just a review for the bar only.i recently visited this hotel last weekend (8/30/2014) and had a horrible experience. i was actually staying at the grand hyatt across the street but decided to stop in to this hotel to get a drink after being caught in the rain.it was after 5pm when my friend and i decided to take a walk to explore atlanta. as soon as we walked across the street from our hotel, rain started to downpour. we decided to stop in at the intercontinental's bar (bourbon bar?) to grab a drink and wait out the rain.when we walked in, i wasn't sure which way to go, so i asked the first employee i saw about ordering a drink. she was an african american female with blonde hair and glasses, and short in stature. she seemed friendly at first and pointed across the room to the bar that i didn't notice when i came in. upon walking over to the bar, my friend and i quickly made up our minds on what we wanted to order.i never saw a bartender behind the bar. i saw the same female walk behind the bar and right past us at least four times. my friend and i moved across the bar a few times trying to find someone to help us. we waited so long, i started to feel uncomfortable as other patrons were starting to look at us like we were crazy.finally, i asked the female, about the bartender and she explained that she was the bartender (what?). i immediately did not like her attitude. she knew we came in to order a drink and even directed us to where the bar was located and proceeded to walk by us four times without bothering to ask us what we wanted. to make matters worse, she charged me for my friends drink without even asking me. i don't mind treating my friend, but i want to be asked first before you charge my card for it.i have nothing bad to say about the appearance of this hotel. you get a very upscale and luxurious feeling upon walking into this hotel and you can tell that the guests here are among some of the wealthiest/powerful people in atlanta. i can't help but feel that if i walked in with my omega watch, my louis vuitton bag, my versace chain, or my giuseppe zanotti heels that i would have been treated better. instead i walked in drenched in rain and i believe, was immediately judged. (this may not be the case, but i could definitely tell a difference between how she interacted with us versus other patrons at the bar.)this experience left an incredibly bad taste in my mouth as i felt like i wasn't wanted in the hotel at all. i usually stay at intercontinental hotels or hyatt hotels. after this experience, i don't think i will stay at another intercontinental again.straight off the bat - the nasty whirlpool ruined my birthday stay at my favorite hotel in atlanta. i live here and to get away - i visit this hotel . i left a hotel in atlanta from a overnight surprise from my friends to finish my birthday here. my girlfriend and i went to the pool, which is amazing, the best i have seen. so after soaking up sun, chatting about how awesome the pool is and the view we headed 10 feet over to the whirlpool (see photos). i usually use caution when entering whirlpools, but i had so much trust in this hotel that i did not check. my girlfriend said, yuk ewww look at the grime. i immediately felt awful and just thought of the exposure to the unknown . i was embarrassed because she was my guest at my favorite spot which i have brought her to at least 3 times this year. i spoke with the front desk (kyle) and requested he see this first hand before i left the area. he assured me that a rep. would (i requested more than housekeeping ). we'll no one came and we stayed until 857 pm and i calls at 645pm.my family recently stayed here for the first time. i was very impressed by the comments that have been made regarding the intercontinental buckhead on trip advisor and decided we would give it a try on a quick visit to atlanta.the staff was very kind and helpful. however, i was quite disappointed in the quality of our room. it turned out that the toilet did not work. a repairman came to our door early the next morning and was surprised to see us there. he stated that it had been previously notified that the toilet didn't work and he was there to replace the faulty fixture. after working on it for a while he was able to get it to flush but said that he would be replacing it later that day after we checked out. we were also surprised and disgusted to find a large hairball on the wall of the shower.i notified the front desk of these discrepancies the next morning, however, we were only offered a parking pass for our self parking in the garage (which i already had). these are not the types of things we would expect to find at a aaa five diamond hotel. the hotel is beautiful and the location superb. i will give them the benefit of the doubt and try them again, however, my expectations won't be quite as high this time.we booked the hotel and were very impressed with the check in process. the bell men and valets were very polite and welcomed us with extreme enthusiasm. we were staying in the area because our daughter is going to agnes scott college. when we checked in the young lady was very nice and pleasant and the three of us were at the desk. upon arriving at our room we found ourselves in a king room. the bellman called the front desk and told them our situation. we were told no other rooms were available and were given the option of a rollaway bed. after it was set up and we were given the extra pillows and blanket from the closet we realized the bed linens and extra blankets were covered in black hair. i immediately called the desk and a new rollaway and linens were provided. this incident really soured our trip. they did make it right but to be honest it was just plain gross. i had a hard time getting the image out of my mind and felt that even though the room was clean knowing there were hairs everywhere made it seem like it wasn'tnarim leininger check me in what a young professional hope this is the future of ihg ! room was amazing comfortable and highest quality . loved the hospitality of the concierge lounge staff was amazing here too...if it wouldn't be for the rude and unhelpful valet parking guys (jerome and others ) it would have been the perfect hotelnow, this is the place to be in buckhead. top notch customer service and well appointed rooms. this is by far the best hotel that my wife and i have stayed and we stay in top notch hotels like hyatt, lowes, ritz carlton to name a few. hotel is just beautiful inside and out. i requested a corner room on the higher floor and they accommodated me. perfect views of the city on one side and the stone mountain view from the other side. bed is super comfy and the bathroom is quite lovely and big. nice deep tub that my wife simply enjoyed. all areas of the hotel is just simply beautiful. visited the southern art bourbon bar and had a blast. everyone of their staff is very friendly and gentleman like. absolutely loved the fact that i didn't have to drive anywhere because they picked us up in their luxury lincoln suv. everything was perfect and clean. completely spotless and i know for a fact that my wife and i will be staying here again when we come back to the atlanta-buckhead area. truly, truly a lasting and wonderful experience on our anniversary getaway. great job!!!!!i had a staycation for two days at the intercontinental and it was amazing from start to finish. as soon as i walked in i was greeted by staff that were very polite and very accomadating. the romm was extremely clean and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. i used their spa, and the service was great, the massage i recieved was beyond relaxing. if you do the spa, ask for sylvia, she has alot of experiance and is good at what she does. the bartenders in the lobby are great too and definite experts at their craft. i have nothing bad to say about my stay and highly reccomend this hotel. i will definitely be going back.i stayed here along with some coworkers during a four-day professional conference. the conference rooms were nice and the food served was very good. actually, the banquet dinner of short ribs and mushroom ravioli was to die for! wifi throughout the building seemed pretty reliable. the hotel rooms were comfortable and clean, and the bathrooms, with the standing shower and separate soaking tub, were really nice.although my stay was perfectly fine, my roommate's was not. she notified the hotel prior to our arrival that she was allergic to down in bedding and requested an alternative. she was assured this would be no problem. upon our arrival, our beds were not marked as being down-free and the front desk agreed that our room had not been changed over yet. she waited six or so hours for the bedding to be switched, but no one ever came. finally, she strongly urged the front desk to make this happen as it was almost midnight, and only then did someone come to our room. come to find out, the room had been switched over prior to our arrival, but not one person was able to verify during that time frame. very bad communication! to top it off, they removed her blanket (obviously not a down comforter as it was more a basic cotton blanket). when she asked for another or her's to be brought back, they said no problem. by our third night, she was using a towel to keep warm because the blanket never came. upon checkout, the front desk asked her if she ever received the correct bedding and blanket because a note had been entered in our reservation. she said no, and the front desk looked surprised. they apologized for the lack of customer service and assured her that it doesn't happen often at their hotel. again, bad communication.the negative aside, the hotel is very nice. the southern art restaurant was amazing, and we even got to hobnob with some celebrities on-site... samuel l. jackson!okay first, i am an ambassador member with intercontinental hotels. i am also a gold elite member with the ihg group.this hotel has has a nice image, but as a guest you get to see the reality. i booked an ambassador suite for 3 nights and was upgraded to the presidential suite. i'm going to list my problems that i encountered:1. the shower was scorching hot. i called down and reported it and they sent someone up to fix it while i was gone. also, they had to replace a light that was burned out. thankfully, i returned while they were still trying to fix the problems. someone told the mechanic that the shower water didn't get hot enough...total opposite of what i told them. and the maid couldn't find the light that was clearly burned out. they do not inspect the room before they rent them to the guests.2. room service food was delicious but only lukewarm on several visits.the only staff that is somewhat nice are room service staff, the front desk, and upper management. everyone else walks around with a sour face.3. tried booking a spa appointment a full day ahead of time. they told me there was no space available. and this was for the guest in the presidential suite, plus i am an ambassador member. this was totally out of line!4. as an ambassador member i am guaranteed a late check-out of 4 pm...guaranteed. it's company policy. but they locked me out of my room by 3:10 and had to send security up to let me in my room. seriously? luxury hotel? no.5. while i was trying to get in my room a cluster of about 3 or 4 maids (housekeeping) saw me struggling and offered no assistance and laughed at me...very loudly. this was preposterous.6. the fireplace in my room emitted a strong gas odor when lit.7. the floors were heavily scratched.8. the bellman or staff do not open the doors for you in the valet area. this has become so standard for staff to open doors...i don't know why they don't do it here.so this is what i did about my problems. i sent an email to hotel staff, who forwarded it to the front desk manager who then forwarded it to the hotel manager. i then replied to his email and copied the general manager to it. the manager told me he would call me back one day, and totally forgot about me. i requested a refund of 2 nights, refund for valet charges, and for 2 in room dining charges. what did i get? an offer for a complimentary night. that's all. and their maids laughed at me! that's awful! don't stay here. most of the staff aren't friendly and upper management is a joke.i will be mailing the corporate office a letter and calling them about this. i will never stay at another intercontinental hotel property again because of the awful way i was treated here. shame on this hotel! i will also be filing a report with the bbb. five star service? no. what a joke!don't stay here. there are much better choices in buckhead, that i have stayed at before.we stayed 9 days at the hotel, so plenty of time to get a good feel. overall, a nice property, however, the service was very inconsistent- either excellent or bad.pros:*the bellman went out of his way each day to greet us and welcome us back to the hotel. he was a delight and very thoughtful.* the beds are very comfortable with nice linens.* outdoor pool is very pretty.* southern food venue is great.* location makes it easy to walk to the mall and great restaurants.* free wifi* room service was good, quick and very friendly service.cons:* two of the first 5 days, housekeeping didn't clean the room. also, they wouldn't come until 5pm-ish when we were getting back after a long day. it was very random. additionally, the didn't take dirty glasses away or give us clean ones. under impressed!* nickel and dimed- charged $50 for in room refridgerator & no complimentrary coffee in the lobby.* tiny room.* front desk staff was minimally helpful. not horrible, but not good either.intercontinental buckhead atlanta is terrible.where do i start...i notified them i was coming for a big anniversary, nonetheless they would not give a complimentary room upgrade but suggested i pay 150 dollars more for an upgrade...(stressing that was less than the normal price). i do not know about you but that does not make me feel special. welcome or a recognition of a special anniversary event. i also told them i had lived at the intercontinental in abidjan for a month and a half but had not registered on their ambassador program, again they could not care less.they did send up a bottle of cheap 10 dollar bubbly wine and watery tasteless strawberries. sure its a nice gesture but when you are spending upwards of 400 dollars for a room with breakfast do not insult me with cheap stuff i would never buy or order.we then asked if we could order some bar snacks for the bubbly wine. no was the answer, we were told we could order chicken wings which would take half an hour and neither of us wanted chicken wings. as we did not see what we wanted to order on the in room dining menu we ordered japanese food. amazingly enough they do not deliver after 9 pm...as the restaurant is less than a mile away and down the street we asked the hotel if they had someone they could send..again no.a 5 star hotel anywhere else in the world would have arranged for a man to go down the street or send a taxi for the pickup. then we ordered coffee through room service. 15 dollars for a pot of coffee!. i frequent many 5 star hotels all over the world, to date this must be the highest price i have ever paid. then in the room: there is no nespresso machine, there is this old fashioned filter brewing contraception.no complimentary water, again even most 4 star hotel have 1 bottle of complimentary water....then breakfast, eggs benedict were on the menu but not included in the inclusive buffet breakfast.cappucino had to be paid for extra as well. i ordered fried eggs and bacon which took 12 minutes (you have to stand and wait and i timed it!) as the chef was busy with room service orders! the only nice part was the very nice bald headed breakfast waiter. for the rest this is a slick money making machine not worthy of it stars and unworthy of the intercontinental chain. i do not recommend this hotel. they are the the type of hotel that has no idea what the words hospitality business really mean.as an ambassador member. i was given a cold shoulder on this stay. didn't get the room that reserved. wasn't offered the usual club level access when expectations couldn't be met. yes - i was spoiled...felt like a king here...till today. welcome to the new intercontinental 2014. from hero...to zero. most of the dining staff know me by name. the front desk has shifted a bit. i guess to visit an average of 2 days a month. is not enough.first, i want to say that to a person, every staff member was exceptionally kind, pleasant and tried to be as helpful as possible. they were great.this hotel simply has no attention to detail. the beds are covered with some sort of super-soft mattress topper, but it squeaks like crazy when you roll over in bed. the toilet paper holder is designed so that when you try to tear off the paper, the whole roll slides onto the floor and roles away leaving toilet paper everywhere.the wire soap holder in the shower won't hold the little mini-bar of soap. it just slips right through so you're constantly picking the soap up off the drain in the floor. a full sized bar of soap would do fine, but not the little ones. the shower door doesn't seal, so there's water all of the floor after every shower.we had a psycho tv. over a 3-night stay, on multiple occasions it would say no signal\" for any number of different channels, then sometimes they'd just magically come on. on the morning of our second day, i turned on the tv and it tuned to the hotel channel and the volume immediately went up to 60. the remote wouldn't work, the buttons on the side wouldn't work and i couldn't reach the plug in the wall. it was a nightmare. i'm sure we woke up most of the folks on 3 floors! i called down to the desk and they sent someone up, but he wouldn't knock on the door because of the do not disturb sign - like we weren't being disturbed by these screaming hotel advertisements!when i checked out, there were over $250 worth of erroneous charges on my bill. i was charged a $100 pet fee for each night of the stay (instead of once for the entire stay) and there were mini-bar charges that weren't legit. they were fixed immediately, but were totally unnecessary.it's in a great location, but for the price of this brand, they need to step it up.\"the public rooms are magnificent, no doubt; however the intercontinental buckhead atlanta did not honor priceline's promised terms; so for me there is an integrity issue.there was confusion about which room i had occupied, with the receptionist at check-out insisting i was someone i'd never heard of, then demanded to see my picture id. i've never been asked for a picture id or any other id at check-out. somehow it got to be my fault they'd screwed up room assignments, and now i have to make certain i don't get stuck with the other guest's charges.my room was small but attractively furnished. there were 2 competing versions of room service menus. the one i saw first said room service ended at 11:00 p.m., and it was 20 minutes or so later. the candy machine had only one item a diabetic could possibly eat: crackers with dried-out peanut butter. the next morning i came across the second version, and this said room service was available 24/7. one thing the 2 menus had in common: outlandish prices.the room was not the corner room with a magnificent view of the city i was promised when i checked in. there was a view of several nearby buildings 6 or 8 floors down, mostly roofs and air-conditioning towers. nor was the room the promised corner room. the key didn't work. the magnificent beveled mirror over the basin in the bathroom with a gorgeous black and silver frame was hung so close to the basin that i hit my knuckles on it when i turned the water on.cheap, thin toilet paper. who needs a dozen huge pillows!? where does one put them in a room this small!? if my wife had been with me it would have been an issue,i was too tired from a long day to hassle about these deficiencies. my actual bill (with no extras) was more than double the priceline quote. i don't mind paying extra for for the best, but i don't like to leave a place with a sense that i've been had.it's not comparable to other 5-star hotels, the four seasons, say, which i plan to return to next time i visit atlanta. the intercontinental in buckhead doesn't deliver a 5-star package in my opinion. it does many things well, but falls short on attention to detail; and when you add the integrity issue, my advise is buyer beware..my wife and i wanted to spend our first night away from our 6 month old daughter in relaxation. we thought the intercontinental was a great spot to enjoy some time together. the check-in experience was great, and we found the staff extremely friendly and accommodating. however, our experience was downhill from there. the shower had almost no water pressure. we're not unreasonable people and we can live with weak\" water pressure. this was almost non existent. it took 5 minutes to rinse my hair. we decided to try a soak in the gorgeous tub. once we filled it up the drain wouldn't work and we had to keep the water on to keep water in the tub. not relaxing. then, at 3:30am we were awakened by a huge fight in the next room. we called the front desk and asked for help as it was a physical altercation between a man and a women. they continued to shout and fight until 5am. it was a disappointing experience for our one chance to get away and relax.\"i stayed for 2 nights, my room was nice, clean and the bed plush. i did like the separate tub in the bathroom. overall a nice place to stay. i did not like room service, the food was horrible. i ordered a beet salad and the salad was wilted. i also ordered grilled cheese and the side fries looked as if they recycled from another plate. the pinot noir was bad, low quality. overall my salad, grilled cheese and 2 glasses of wine was horrible, and it only cost me 75$.let me tell you about my extraordinarily insulting experience at this supposed 4 star hotel. upon check out i brought my luggage to my valeted car. the bellhop was loading the car and i was looking in my purse for the ticket. my paid hotel bill was in my other hand. a very short middle eastern man in a suit came up to me and started pulling insistently at the bill in my hand. as i thought he was wanting the valet ticket i told him i was looking for it. he finally snatched it out of my hand and opens it up and states, quite loudly, while pointing to the bill, you didn't pay for this!!\" i looked at him and told him i most certainly did pay for the valet, as the front desk attendant mentioned it and told me i would be charged for it. which was perfectly acceptable. this man kept on saying that i had not paid for my valet and that the bill was for my room. (in fact, it was for my incidentals, such as valet). because it was not itemized i could not prove it. he took the bill and snatched the valet ticket out of my hand and went to the side desk. i asked him three times to please give me my bill back so i could go get an itemized copy to prove to him i had indeed paid for valet. he refused to give it back for about 3 minutes while he rudely ignored me. he did finally give it back, and i marched back to the front desk and reported this encounter and received an itemized bill which proved i had paid. i was infuriated. as many hotels as i have stayed at in my life, from motel 6 to the ritz, i have never, ever been treated like such a third class citizen. the unfortunate part is that it is actually a very nice hotel and i was excited because i had planned on bringing my boyfriend there in the future. however, i will never step foot on an intercontinental property again. this is a hotel. customer service should be job one. if the gentleman (i use that term lightly) had an issue, he should have done it in a quiet manner. he was loud and obtrusive and utterly insulting. as i was too flabbergasted at the time, i unfortunately did not get his name, although i will not forget his snide face. take my advice and find somewhere that appreciates your business and doesn't interrogate you as to whether you paid your bill.\"i attended a weekend conference here, and was very impressed with my overall experience. we were shuttled to and from airport, but location is 1 block from marta if you are one of those folks who prefer to leave the driving to others!everything about this hotel is nice, but if i'm already paying top dollar to stay here, i shouldn't be overcharged for everything else. by this i mean the food, but mostly the parking. they told me multiple times that i would be charged $22 for self parking ($32 for valet). however, i was very surprised when i checked out and my card was charged $44, as i had paid cash for everything but parking. upon calling the hotel, i was informed that parking was $22 per day. we booked the hotel for two nights but actually only stayed there for one night. in addition, upon checking in, i paid $8 to park, on top of the $44 that was charged to my card. this is not only ridiculous, but they did not ever tell us that it was $22 per day. every time they mentioned it, they said, ''you will be charged $22 for parking.'' not once did they ever say 'per day.' i am not pleased.nice until the end when we had to deal with the rude persian guy who i think was the manager. he needs to learn how to interact with people. other than that it was nice. the rest of the staff were hospitable. food was pretty good as well.this my all time favorite place to stay!!! they know me by name each and every time i come. i visit here very often. in oct i had someone in parking to be very rude. the hotel bent over backwards to fix the problem. on my most recent stay ( jan 2, 2013) they really made my dreams come true, the work really hard to keep their customers happy. outstanding customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! many, many many thanks to edwin, aubrey and vinnie. great staff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we will be back; as always :)!ihg prides itself on the quality of their brand. this particular hotel doesn't live up to those expectations and is need of refresher training to staff and management alike. we won't be back. i encourage others to try a different hotel. this hotel should be near the bottom of your list if service and quality are important to you. the staff and management of this hotel have mastered the art of lip service but are unable to follow through.here's a quick list of the issues we experienced:- the bed was the most uncomfortable we've ever slept on.- the temperature controls in the room did not work.- the room was considerably smaller than the advertised size.- we pre-paid for a room and on arrival found that the room did not match the description.- the phone and voice mail in the room did not work.- it took the valet over 30 minutes to find our car after we found one.all of the above happened on a busy weekend. we brought each of the issues to the front desk management several times during our stay. we were told that there were no refunds. in addition, we were unable to find an alternate hotel after we checked in. ihg customer service and the hotel management were unwilling to work with us to resolve the issues during and after our stay.despite repeated attempts to resolve the issue with the hotel by phone, email, postal mail, and through the credit card company - the hotel refuses to return phone calls, respond to letters, or discuss any aspect of our stay. these outcomes are not what a five star hotel provides.the hotel is in a great location and looks great on the outside and in the lobby but then it ends...or at least for me it did. i am all for recycling and green practices but a sign placed on my bed every day reminding me to reuse my towels was funny the first two days of a nine night stay but not much after that. i also had a nice soap dish the first two nights that got replaced with a tissue. i had to ask for towels...and the best was trying to get a roll of toilet paper delivered to my room at 11 pm...it didn't happen. if it wasn't for the comfy bed this would have been one of the worst stays ever for me for a business trip.loved the hotel, however i expected the reception personnel to have better customer service. an error was made with the reservation however the reception staff displayed no customer service in attempting to resolve the issue. not only was the on duty desk staff person very matter of fact without any attempt to understand the situation, her senior level supervisor only interjected with the exact same stiff, matter of fact response. i certainly doubt, with the level of success of the franchise, that their actions are representative and would hate to believe stereotyping played a role in the treatment i was subjected to. words of advice, do not expect individualized service at this facility.we had reserved 14 rooms as our family gathered for our son's wedding(not being held at the hotel). we made several requests to have the rooms as close together as possible. we especially emphasized that we needed an adjoining room for my mother in law who has dementia. upon checking in we were told that there was an adjoining room but we got up to the room we saw that the room was not adjoining. we were apparently using the incorrect term and was then told that what we really wanted was a connecting room but that they dont have any of those. we were then told that they did find a connecting room for us and that they would send up a bellhop with the new key and that he would transfer us to the newer room. after 45 minutes and several calls to the desk(they insisted that someone was on the way up!) we went downstairs to get the new key and moved ourselves. the wait was exhausting for my mother in law as well as all of us who had spent the day traveling. none of the other rooms were close to one another even though we requested when the reservations were made and upon checkin. this set a very negative tone\" for what was supposed to be the beginning of a very special weekend for us.on a different day i called to request that someone help to raise/open an umbrella at the pool(which is an unattended pool). it took several calls and 25 minutes before someone did come. each time i called i was told that there was someone on the way.arrangements were made by my son with the front desk for the distribution of gift bags to his guests. i was in charge of delivering the bags to all the hotels as well as ours. the gentleman at the front \"out of it\" is the only way i can describe it. we could not make him understand what we wanted. it took about 15 minutes for us to make him understand even though my son had already filled out this in a written request and was told that all we had to do was rop off the bags and mention the name of the room block.my daughters room had 2 double beds, one of which had some type of sandy debris at the foot of one of the beds on the first night. they requesed a chage of sheets the next day and then there was no more problems.one of the other guests was told that their luggage would be sent up and it never was. she finally went downstairs and was told that there was a mix up in the names and she found her luggage unattended on a cart in the lobby.our first night we sat in the lobby and tried to order drinks. service was very slow and the drinks were mixed drinks(apple martini and manhattan) that were awful. as more family came in, we continued to drink in the lobby on other days and nights and the service was much better but i had to caution my guests to keep their orders simple due to our experience the first night.the hotel was very pretty, the rooms adequate in size. i was uncomfortable with the toilet and shower being in a sperate room but with no door to have any privacy from the sink area and tub.the concierge was extremely competent and helpful on several occasions and different staff.the breakfast buffet was great and the service there wonderful each morning.\"i really enjoyed this hotel! my husband and i have been to this hotel and absolutely loved it!!! i highly recommend the intercontinental hotel to everyone. the customer service was excellent, the room was clean, and the food was excellent!my wife and daughter spent a weekend over this past summer at the intercontinental, a hotel in which we have stayed on numerous occasions. the room was as usual, very nice; however,the niceness stopped there. when requesting assistance with a card key to access the club level, the security personnel who finally showed up was simply unfriendly (maybe he was having a bad day). when she finally got to the club level, she noticed that there was no personnel outside the club level area (as there had been in years past) and then noticed that without such personnel, guests (we presume) of the hotel were loading up with beer and liquor (yes, the whole bottle) and taking it down to their rooms via elevator. later, she learned that the hotel had a new owner. from there, my daugher mentioned she smelled smoke on their floor but my wife knew the smell was not cigarettes but a different kind of smoke. is there no security or hotel personnel that would discover this? finally, in the lobby on saturday night, when three ladies of the night\" were shown the way to get from the garage elevator to the elevator bank for the hotel rooms by a hotel employee, she realized the hotel had really changed. we will find another hotel in atlanta. interesting, we emailed the hotel about this occurrence and never heard back from them. adios, intercontinental.\"checked in about 8 months ago and it took at least 20 minutes for luggage to be delivered. the front desk agent was by himself and the manager did not even bother to assist. the manager does not even acknowledge that someone is waiting in line to check in. i ask for an upgrade at a price and i was told its not worth paying anything extra all rooms are the same. i get to the room and called room service and no one answers, and then i got a hold of someone who did not speak english. tv did not work, engineering never showed up to fix the issue. i just tried it for one night because the four seasons was fully booked, and it was my 1st and last time at an intercontinental. this is my 1st review on trip advisor, as i usually fill out guest comment cards or send a thank you email for a pleasant stay. would not recommend this hotel and i would spend a little extra and stay at the st.regis or four seasons.stayed for one day [never wanted to leave!][gift from friends for birthday]. lovely property.great location.average swimming pool.great bar. did not eat at souther art[highly rated restaurant].most of buckhead restaurants are nearby. our fav-maggiano's.hotel has a beautiful garden[enclosed], where you can have your evening cocktails.walk in price is higher for the similar room[ $185].grand hyat nearby has much cheaper price,but if you can get a good deal on 'priceline/hotwire'--grab it!the ic hotel at buckhead is a beautiful property with polite and friendly employees. the staff that greeted us was very professional and courteous. we were taken care of almost immediately. the rooms are gorgeous and well suited to the price (paid approx $200). i found the bed to be super comfortable which is always nice. everything was clean and absolutely gorgeous in regards to furnishings, etc. the restaurant wasn't my favorite but i do not really love southern cooking the way others so. we also took advantage of the club level which was well worth it. the servers in that area were superb and learned our names the first day. highly recommend!the ic hotel at buckhead is a beautiful property with polite and friendly employees. the rooms are gorgeous and well suited to the price (paid approx $200). i found the bed to be super comfortable which is always nice. highly recommend!now this is a hotel that does it right. everything from the rooms to the restaurant to the staff was top-notch. i believe one's expectations should mirror what you are booking. in other words, if you choose a holiday inn express...don't expect a five-star experience, and vice versa. this one lived up to it's pedigree and then some. the chef from the restaurant was oprah's chef for 10 years...and she's never looked like she was in danger of wasting away. try the restaurant out and you'll see why. try the sweet potato casserole as a side, all i can say is wow!\"\"we booked 3 rooms on the conceirge level for our party and were pleased with the rooms, but the service was lacking. we paid extra for the concierge level so that we could enjoy the concierge suite. unfortunately, the offerings were rather, foo foo,\" and unappetizing- especially for breakfast. had a better hotel breakfast at a 3 star hotel on our trip. the other problem was that room service was slow and served our food cold. finally, the air conditioning did not work well in our room so, despite an incredibly comfortable bed, we did not get a good night's sleep.\"i have to say i was quite disappointed in our stay here. we went for a romantic over night get away. we decided to get the spa package and then get a couples massage. when we checked in they seemed very nice and even called the spa for us to tell them we would be arriving shortly. after our spa treatment we were told to go take advantage of the tub in our room. so we did. when we got out we realized that they only had one robe for the room. we checked the closet but nothing. then about 2 hours after our massage while we were getting ready for dinner we had a knock on our door. it was the hotel to give us our spa treatment gift package that had all the stuff you are supposed to use in the bath. it kind of irritated me that we received this so long after our massage and after we had already taken a bath. then we go into the fridge in the room to see that it is out of almost everything except peanuts and one soda each. when we were about to pull out of the parking garage we noticed that they were apparently supposed to have given us a parking pass when we checked in, which they forgot to do. then we come back to the room and want to relax and watch some on demand movies when we notice that although everything says they have on demand they do not. the next morning i was reading the book they give you about the hotel which states that each room is supposed to have two robes, that they have on-demand movies, in room check-out, etc. however they had none of these things. when we checked out i informed the woman of the missing robe, the late arrival of the spa gift package, the under stocked fridge and she basically said that it shouldn't have been like that but that it was housekeeping who is responsible. then when i mentioned that we could not get the on-demand or in-room check out she said it was because they recently upgraded to flat screens and the on-demand and in-room check out were not working with the new tv's. i told her in a case like that they should inform the guests or at least have a notice in their rooms.all in all i would not stay there again. it was too much money for that many complaints.a guest left a key for me at the front desk. i went to pick it up, spoke with the lady who confirmed she received it, spoke with a manager with her. they assured me they were looking for it. i left a phone number and confirmed with both that i needed the key to access an apartment i was flying to the next morning and asked that they call me so i could return (30 minute drive) to pick it up that night. i am a regular guest at the hotel and they said they would call me. at a little before midnight, still no call. i called to find out why they had not called and they said sorry\" we couldn't find it so we did not call you. now i am making a hotel reservation at my expense and they could care less.\"one good thing happened at the hotel for me. upon arriving, after a long drive to atlanta, i was permitted to check in early with no additional cost.pros: the bed was comfortable the room was well decorated. the pool was nice and the spa facilities were pleasant. on the surface the hotel was very nice.cons: everything else. i agree with another reviewer that stated it appears the management may have some issues. that was my thought while i was there, maybe they are just cutting corners but the lack of attention to detail was mind blowing for a hotel with this rating. the restaurant and bar were being renovated, which is fine but they placed tables and a bar in the center of the hotel lobby making navigation to the lobby elevators uncomfortable. i don't care to walk through people having dinner while carrying my luggage, nor do i care to pass by a bar where drunk people are glaring at my wife. they do have conference rooms that could have been utilized for this purpose.on the floor where i stayed, near the elevators, where a courtesy phone was placed, a glass of beer sat for 3 days in a row. the carpet in my room was not vacuumed prior to my arrival nor was it vacuumed during my stay. there was in room coffee, it was horrible coffee, there was just one caffeinated and one decaffeinated pack of coffee each day. if you want more beg. the first day the coffee cups in my room were cleaned with my shower soap leaving a strong soap smell on the cups. the next day i found a long blond hair on a cup (my wife is a brunette, i have short hair) and yes the cup smelled like shower soap again....my thought was the staff may have been using the washcloth from another guest room to clean the cups with my bath soap and it had the hair on it (made me wonder how long the cups may have been cleaned this way). the ice bucket was never drained, after using it each day. the replacement towels were stacked on the bathtub and were not placed on the hangars, each day. i never saw any of the staff on my floor during my stay. the garden area outside was weed infested and the hedges were untrimmed, the lawn had tons of dirt patches where grass should be. parking was expensive, $20 for self parking $30 for valet. there was a loud party every night.if you are a well seasoned traveler you will find this hotel does not deserve a 4 star rating. it is a well appointed 3 star at best. not worth the cost. i would not recommend this hotel to friends or family, nor would i stay there again.a year ago we skipped the ritz and decided to try the intercontinental. it was the right decision mainly because of how nice the staff was. this time we came back for the weekend and the hotel has gone steeply downhill. starting with our check in friday we had to wait until after 5 to get in the room. no apology. next we find that they have given up in room movies and insteadnputnin dvds. about like removing ipads and replacing with calligraphy pens. we then go and check out from a selection of 20 dvds and it messes up in five minutes. the not friendly guy checking them out threatens me with a 50 dollar fine if they don't get returned. room service took over 50 minutes for a 15 dollar club sandwich..... 21 percent tip added...i don't mind a 21 percent tip for excellent service....to add it in automatically is insulting. the hotel restaurant is closing in august...calling the front desk you get put on hold for 5 minutes.....something has changed here....bottom line.....not as good as the ritz, westin or je marriottyou'd be hard pressed to find anything wrong with this hotel. good location for getting around atlanta and in one of the nicest parts of the city. the hotel has a very clean and high-end feel, but not pretentious. the service was a+ in every regard.my only complaint would be to have more wheelchairs available. my wife broke her ankle and was on crutches, and both times we stayed here all the wheelchairs were taken, leaving her quite a walk on crutches to get to the rooms.as one would expect, the hotel is kept in perfect shape. the standard guest rooms are large, including the bathroom which have a separate tub organized in a spa\" looking set up. a separate shower is very nice enclosed with glass / marble. the main room is complete with a 42' wide-screen tv, large desk, easy chair, ottoman. the hotel is very quiet, but busy. during my stay, no hallway or adjoining room noise was heard.everything in the room worked as designed. as with many upper class hotels, there is no refrigerator or microwave in the room, replaced with a mini-bar that will charge you for a product if you remove it from the unit for more then 20-seconds. there is on-site parking (for a fee). although i drove to this hotel, i was told it‚äôs a short walk to the marta train station.i give house-keeping two thumbs up! the room was extremely clean, \"as if i was the first guest in this room...clean\"! each day, housekeeping did it all over again! no spots missed, or corners overturned.the only thing that bothered me was at check in. i both requested & asked for a high floor room. i was told that they could only give me the 10th floor, all floors above that were \"club suites\"....sir, would you like to upgrade for $$$ more per night? i said no, 10th floor is fine. i traveled with part of a very large group, i later found out i had the lowest floor of everyone in my group, i looked at a friend‚äôs room on the 16th floor...it was the same room as mine, even the same side of the building. being on the 10th floor was fine with me, but being lied to at the front desk on check in really had me steaming! at least tell me a white lie, and say the rooms are booked, that that's all they have. but trying to get me to pay more was really rotten!another fellow from my group had a different issue, the hotel double booked his room, he was asleep when another couple opened his door and walked in with their suitcases. it was an error made by the front desk... just remember; always use the dead-bolt!\"i really loved the inter buckhead!!! the location is perfect!!!! the service and hotel areas are amazing!!!!!!! i will stay there over and over again!!!!!!!!we stayed just one night at this hotel (total of 9 hours). found a great rate on hotwire which the hotel refers to as a third party\" - that is where the customer service ended. we checked in at midnight so the hotel knew which rooms they had available. they offered us smoking rooms or non-smoking doubles (first they said full size then they said queen size - after going to the room they were doubles)! they were not sold out so i knew they had other rooms available which we wanted otherwise they wouldn't have been on hotwire! the hotel told us they save these rooms for their direct customers and i said i understood that but at midnight you would know what rooms you had available! they blamed it on their computer even though i was speaking to a human while checking-in. needless to say the non-smoking queen room they miraculously found had a tub whose drain wasn't working (and this is a new hotel too). at checkout when i mentioned it they told me they would fix that for me - as if they were doing me a favor! the hotel is nice and the rooms are nice so it's a shame the service is horrendous! i would never recommend or refer this hotel. there are soooo many other hotels in this area which i've stayed at where the customer service is superb (like across the street!) customer service can make or break a place and in this economy service is everything!!! they also charge your room $20 a night for parking. how did they know we arrived by car? how did they know we parked in their lot? how did they know how long we parked in their self-parking lot? when questioned about the charge - the employee just handed me the receipt and said \"that was what they charged\" as if to dismiss me! this was my first and last time at an intercontinental hotel! i've stayed at the very very best hotels - and this one never again!\"the rooms were lovely, the bath tub was incredible, and the staff was willing to go out of their way for us. we brought our own dvd player and couldn't get it to work on the tv. we called down to ask for directions and and engineer was in our room 5 minutes later, hooking it up! the only downside...the bed was terribly uncomfortable. way too soft. we sank into the middle.i used priceline and got a room for under $100. i was happy about the deal until i got to the hotel and they told me i had to choose between a double bed room and a smoking king. the person who checked me in was rude and did not take the time to try to help me find an alternative. thinking the smoking king was the better choice, i accepted the room. the whole smoking floor (6th) smells disgusting and the room smelled like an ashtray. i expect more from the intercontinental brand- regardless of whether i priceline a room. i would never pay to stay there again.the hotel in all honesty is good but they charge for everything, internet $6.95/ hr or $12.95/day, parking is $7.00 /hr or $ 20.00 a day....and items in the fridge are computerized, remove anything from fridge and you pay whether or not you consume them plus there is no microwave....needless to say it started out like a good deal but the end bill after four days was more than i had hoped for. if my company was paying or someone else for that matter it would have been excellent....beware of the little charges....they add up un-believablythis is a really lovely hotel. for the price i offered on priceline, i'm always a little afraid of what i'm going to get, but i got a great deal on a posh room with a great view. special thumbs up for the elegant bathroom, which had a huge bath and separate shower. and the bar scene in the lobby seemed very lively.too bad someone else's half-eaten meal was still in the room when we arrived. calling the front desk to complain didn't work, the woman asked if i had left the food there (um, no) and sent up housekeeping, who were utterly confused about where the mess was. oh, you need room service,\" the maid said. yes, whatever, get me room service. the room service man showed up and kept asking if we wanted to keep any of the food. \"do you want the cookies? the water?\" no! it's not our food!once the food was cleared, we decided to order room service ourselves. only the guy on the phone didn't speak very good english and didn't understand what \"greek salad\" was, what \"cabernet\" was and what \"knob creek\" was. it was a mess. we sort of got our order, aside from the wrong wine, and i just sighed and looked out the window, soothed by the view. if you value good service, go elsewhere. but the hotel itself as a property is very nice.\"i was very dissatisfied with my recent stay at the intercontinental buckhead hotel. to bein with, the lobby is very crowded and loud on friday and saturday nights because of the xo bar.the staff is friendly and competent only as long as there are no problems. as soon as there any issues, no one wants to help you and all the staff can do is tell you about hotel policy. it appears no one has the ability to use common sense or discretion in special situations. so expect to be treated more like a number than a hotel guest on your stay. don't expect sincere apologies either.the brunch/lunch buffet at au pied de cochon is lousy - it's always cold, tasteless, and quite expensive for what it is.the only redeeming factor for the hotel is the modern updateddecorating in the rooms and the lobby as well as its location near lenox and phipps plaza. fortunately, there are plenty of other hotels in the area as well as new ones going up.finally, make sure to double check your final bill as someone else's bar tab somehow made it inot our bill.first, let me preface this review by saying that the intercontinental buckhead is in an outstanding location, is a brand new (less than 3 years) property and the staff seem to be competent and extremely helpful.that being said i have a few issues with what could be a superb hotel. firstly, the prices for the rooms are outrageous for no better than they are. i had booked a $149.00 friday and saturday night rate, which i would consider very good for this location and property. unfortunately, my work schedule changed and i had to add a thursday night to my plans. well, the rate jumped up to $389 for the thursday night!! i thought it was quite ridiculous (this is atlanta folks, not nyc!) but in the essence of not being inconvenienced in changing hotels reluctantly accepted it. i am also a platinum priority club member and there were no discounts available, etc. i completely understand the difference in rates versus nights of the week but this rate (for a non club floor) seemed to be incredibly outrageous! this hotel also nickles and dimes you for everything. parking is $17.00 for self service - i believe $25 for valet. internet is also an additional $10.95 per day.it really got my ire when i saw other reviewers on trip advisor commenting how they had used priceline to book similar rooms for $79.00! i feel this is a complete slap in the face! that priceliners are bidding and receiving the same room that i paid $379 a night for is absurdity! that speaks volumes about this hotel and how it must not be doing very well financially. i think it is great that priceliners can get such a bargain but i feel slighted that at the very least i could have received a similar room for somewhere under $389 - especially since i pay full fares and stay in 150+hotel nights a year.i stayed on the 18th floor and will say that the entrance to the hotel, the lobby, the elevator area and other common areas are extremely nice. the staff seemed pleasant enough and while not overwhelmingly friendly i have no issue with them. the standard rooms are adequately sized with nice views of buckhead. the bathrooms are the cornerstone of this location and have a nice shower and a separate soaking tub with nice tile floors. overall, this would be a great room for $149 a night - even up to $199 a night - for $379 it was a complete rip off.also, for a property to charge and aspire to be a luxury hotel the room furnishings, its fixtures and bathroom amenities were sub par. the bedding, while nice, was not luxury at all - as promised by hotel literature. the furniture was showing a bit of wear and tear and to make matters worse there was a shower cap over the room's smoke detector. who knows how long that was even up there. the bathroom fixtures were adequate but nothing opulent and the selection of toiletries was poor. it just seems that the attention to detail is poor to non existent in this hotel.the inattention to detail at an intercontinental hotel was dismaying. on the 18th floor i noticed areas of carpeting that appeared dingy and small pieces of refuse along the baseboards that you would think would be swept everyday but ending up being there for the entirety of my 3 day stay. also, the very nice doors to the rooms were noticeably scuffed from luggage along the bottom and some were really bad. you would think that someone would touch up these doors routinely and keep the carpet fresh.i had previously stayed at this location in february of 2005 right after it first opened and found it to be reasonably priced, very nice and clean. in the two and a half years since my last stay it seems that it has gone downhill. for some reason the attention to detail, which is what constitutes a 4 star hotel from others is lacking. as i stated previously, this hotel's prices are ridiculous. in my opinion this rooms would be great at $149-$199 a night. at $379 it was a complete rip off.because it is imperative that i am guaranteed a wheelchair accessible room, i called the property directly and was given a confirmed accessible room. the hotel manager promised that this room was blocked and guaranteed it upon arrival, which is all nicely stated in an email. well, they lied. arrived and was told i'm sorry, we do not have accessible rooms available.\" that was it, the manager was unwilling to help so i had to leave. how can this be if i was guaranteed this room in writing? you tell me. i do know that it is illeagal and action will be taken so that this does not happen to other disabled travelers.\"this is my third time staying at the intercontinental hotel.-rooms are nice, bathroom is nicer.-if you are booking through priceline or orbitz, i would reccommend looking at your credit card bill online as soon as you leave.- on my second stay the hotel charged me for the room and i pre-paid through priceline, so i was charged for both nights twice. i didn't receive a response from the hotel when i questioned them about it, so i went through priceline and they resolved the issue within a few days.- on my third stay i was charged $120, extra, for what- i have no idea. it was credited back to my account about one week later and i hadn't gotten around to questioning it.bottom line. the hotel is nice, but double check your cc statements to make sure you should receive the charges they are billing you for.after a chaotic check-in on a busy saturday we arrived at our room 45 minutes after arriving at the hotel. we had a formal event that evening and my wife wanted something quick to eat before attending the cocktail party. i called room service 3 times (after being put on hold for 5 minutes twice) and was told they were very busy (at 4:00pm) and it would be an hour to get any food. i ordered a pizza and it arrived as promised in an hour. turndown service arrived at 4:45pm and when i answered the door she handed me a piece of chocolate and said have a nice evening. i asked her to come back in 30 minutes which of course never happened.i called the next morning and asked for a late check out of 1:00pm instead of noon. i was told there were no late check outs and if i stayed in the room i would be charged 25% of room rate. i explained we just wanted to eat breakfast in the hotel and she again informed me we are very busy\". that was the theme of the day, they were all very busy. breakfast took over an hour because you guessed it, they were very busy.the hotel is self is nice, rooms well organized and pleasing in decorations. but the service is a joke. the training or lack there of is rediculous for a facility that wants to compete with the ritz. all i can say is i can not wait for the new st. regis to open nearby.\"a police convention was going on so the parking lot was fullllll,, there was noooo place to park. i don't think they had rooms there either, they had just rented the ball room. i didn't think it was fair for the paying guests to have no place to park but the hotel didn't seem to mind. the rooms were nice, room service was good, pool was nice, very beautiful. but.... my husband went to the bar area to order a drink, (he is hispanic) the lady was very rude and asked him if he was a guest at the hotel, he said yes he was. he told her he would like to pay for the drink cash instead of it going on the room bill. he had his drink paid cash for it, and felt very uncomfortable with the way this waitress was treating him. he left and when we checked out the drink was on our room bill!!!!! now it was our word against the ladies that he paid for the drink with cash already. we couldn't believe a 5 star hotel would have servers like this!!!!! i get treated better then that at the waffle house. anyway, we explained what happened to the gentleman at the check out desk and he was very nice and seemed very concerned and surprised that one of their waitresses would do that. he got us to give him a description of her, and we left feeling like he would investigate it and confront this woman. of course i don't know what ever came of it. hummmgreat hotel but - on my second night, a thur night while on the 22nd floor - club level, i hear a party going on and decide i'd better call the front desk b4 i lose a night sleep. i call at 10 and the party continues, again at 12 midnight i call, the party continues, at 1:30am i call again and finally the party breaks up. the next day i attempt to speak to the manager or asst mgr - neighter are available. the desk clerk tells me it requires2 warning b4 they take action - so don't be patience make your complaints quickly. it's a pretty hotel but i think it was a preferred quest they allowed to party until 130am w/o regards to other quest. if this hotel is to be sucessful they have to take care of their quest which they did not do i my case. my email address is jcray@ccim.net and i was mistreated while a guest at the intercontinental hotel, buckhead atlanta ga.if you are booking this on a third party site such as orbitz, travelocity, or hotwire avoid. we were treated a little bit better than lepers. after checking in we took our bags to the counter for someone to take them up to our room. after being looked at for a couple of minutes we walked our bags up ourselves. the bellhops just watched us walk away. our room a/c didn't work and the bath drain was broken. the only positive on this trip was the fact the hotel did move us to another room. i was told i'd be called and i could pick up the new room keys then. i was never called and 45 minutes later i went to the service desk. the keys had been there for 30 minutes according to the person at the desk. i was reminded before walking away you did book through a third party site\" you think? should we be treated as second class citizens since we're bargain shoppers? we were dressed better than most there so i knew the only reason we got the cold shoulder was due to the fact that we booked through a third party site. this is really out of the ordinary for me as i'm not a complainer at all. trip advisor should check on some of the reviews because there are obviously some fake ones on there. my wife, sister in law, and i loved the beauty of the hotel. we didn't like the service nor the pompous attitude we received.\"promises one thing offers another. hotel staff plays the blame it on someone else game rather than solving problems. they rang bell and barged in without waiting for us to get the door and i was naked. we checked out two hours after arriving and stayed at the westin which is a real classy hotel. email me for more details. if you choose to stay somewhere else it will be well worth the money that the staff said i couldn't get back.we usually stay at the grand hyatt, but this trip we stayed at the intercont. bcs it was were the function was we were attending. we came in town for a function and ended up staying 1 week+ due to evacuations in our city in fl. as you enter, the hotel is beautiful and so was our suite, but that's as far as it went.... usually we stay in suites so we can have one room, our son can have one room and our daughter can sleep on the pullout- but there was no pullout. she slept on a tiny narrow hard sofa for a week, bless her heart. the beds were comfortable but with a feather top mattress and a feather cover we woke up many times drenched in sweat. our room could never get cool enough anyway. we kept the temp on 60 in our room and it was still warm and kept the other bedroom on 74 bcs it was freezing in my son's room. we asked housekeeping for extra washclothes one day and they brought a stack, but the next day they took them all back. the mini bar was never restocked and housekeeping took a bathroom trash can- i had to ask the front desk to correct all of this, twice. they do allow pets, which was nice since we traveled with our puppy, but one morning i fortgot my key after taking our dog out and they treated me like some bum off the street when i asked for another key, they even called security bcs i didn't have id, yet i could varify all the info in their computer!! don't even get me started on valet parking- unorganized and often was not running properly and was always behind and backed up. the food was so-so (really good a tthe fuction but the in-room menu was yuck!) and yet very pricey. the walls are paper thin. i felt like we were staying in a party hotel- drunk yuppies everywhere, doors slamming all hours of the night, same sex couples making out in the elevator while i was with my 3 yr old!!! it was a nightmare. the only polite workers there were the 2 my husband tipped $20- so we bought their manners. we will never stay there again, its back to the quiet, classy, elite gh for us. we wasted too much money there on food, tips, the room, etc.nearly $300 per night for what was not as nice as many hyatt locations where i like to stay. complete ripoff. hair on the floor of the bathroom. guest internet not able to connect. receptionist at front desk completely patronizing and unfriendly - she actually repeated the same standard verbiage to me twice without realizing, like a robot.everything is extremely overpriced! not that i had any intention of ordering room service, but the prices are truly egregious. $300 for a bottle of grey goose vodka? seriously??? this is $35 at my local store. just one example of many regarding what a total and complete ripoff all food and drinks are. total price-gouging.i will never stay here again, and i will inform friends and colleagues to never stay hethe hotel experience itself was solid. the gym is outstanding. the bar made great cocktails. the location was great - short walk from tons of restaurants & the marta.unfortunately, all of this was negated when they tried to sneak an extra $40 charge onto my account. when i called to clear it up, they treated me like it was my fault the charge was added. i am tired of all the ways hotels try to sneak extra charges onto guests.i'm in day 2 of a five-day stay and this place is a service fail! i swear if first impressions are lasting, well then this is the motel 8. there have been several fails from a service perspective that i have experience and i'm only on day 2 of this stay. i think i could've stayed at courtyard and gotten better service. first, upon arrival, no one offered to help me with my bags so i ended up dragging four bags to my room myself. after dragging the bags up, i realized that the keys i was given did not work so i had to go back downstairs to have them reprogrammed. at check in no one asked me if i had a vehicle and i only found out about the parking process when i attempted to leave the garage and access the gate with my regular room key. apparently, the front desk failed to inform me of the parking process and that i needed another card for that. so i had to back out of the exit entrance, repark and go to the lobby to get the actual card needed. housekeeping... i went to the gym in the morning and expected my room to be cleaned as normal since i didn't have any privacy settings on. when i got back to my room it was in the same state. i found out later after flagging down a housekeeper that i had to put a card on the door that says please clean my room. another front desk fail. why didn't anyone tell me about this at check in??? next. my room should be direct billed to the company it was set up that way by the travel agency. upon check in i confirmed this and the representative informed me that she didn't see such a thing, but after going back and forth with her for a solid 5 minutes she finally when to seek help and found the appropriate directives. she finally saw something in the system and said that my card would only be on file for incidentals. well, low and behold my card was charged for a random $349 and somehow the credit card information that the stay should be billed to was deleted from the system. this place is a nightmare. broken processes and lack of qc everywhere. i'm ready to go!sadly, it only takes a few crappy apples to ruin the entire bunch. here are 2 stories to describe the overall attitude at this property.i am sure there are wonderful people here however‚ä¶‚ä¶incident a:when i arrived my driver pulled up to the hotel entrance. my livery driver had a very nice black suv - so its not like we pulled up in a junky toyota (not that it would have mattered). i get out and my driver is pulling my luggage out of the back. there are 3 young, male staff members standing by the door. they look at my driver pulling out my bags and then at me getting out of the suv. not one of them offered to help me out or help with bags. nope, they all stood there looking at talking to each other. they did not budge. my driver begins wheeling my luggage in! we get all the way to the door and then one of the young men begrudgingly walks over and hastily wheels stuff in. no ‚äúhello or welcome to lowes‚äù.incident b:tried to make myself some coffee and the keurig is broken. i used the house phone and dialed 0 ‚äúguest services‚äù answered. i said- ‚äúhello im in room xyz and our coffee machine is broken‚äù. she replies ‚äúbroken, what do you mean broken‚äù i reply ‚äúbroken as in i turn it on and it turns off and it does not make coffee‚äù - she does not reply - dead silence for an awkward time. then she finally says we will send housekeeping over to replace the machine. i wait about an hour. then i call back and say ‚äúhi im in room xyz housekeeping never showed up with our coffee maker, i need to step into the shower now and can‚äôt be disturbed so please cancel‚äù she does not say sorry - she just says ‚äúok‚äù. the silent pauses i mentioned above are better described as ‚äúannoyed pauses‚äù. clearly, she was in the middle of something very important because both of my calls seemed to put her out.on a positive note:the lovely older gentleman (bellman) who helped bring my bags to my room was lovely. he took the time to tell me all about the hotel and the car service. he belongs at the ritz carlton or four seasons. he is ‚äúluxury‚äù.conclusion:i would not recommend this property to anyone. we travel to atlanta for business and will not be returning.we have had the pleasure and of living in and visiting atlanta for decades. we know and enjoy the city. on visits, we have stayed at several hotels from mid-tier to high end. loews is priced high end but the service does not match the price. in the midst of our third day of a five day stay, we have already decided we will not be back. issues - room type not what we reserved, shower not functioning properly, being awakened by construction without notification, valet forgetting to get car, having to help load bags into car while 4 of 5 people stood around and watched. you pay for what you get but you sometimes do not get what you pay for. that has been our experience here. at the price point, we would expect service like we have gotten at the ritz carlton, four seasons, and mandarin oriental on other stays. so far, it has not even been close. do not like to complain but to be forewarned is to be forearmed.we arrived to check in to find out there was no swimming pool - we told the check in agent it was misleading since the photos on amex travel for the loews hotel atlanta has a swimming pool on the first photo. she agreed as did the manager stating many people are mislead by this.after check in we went to our room the key however did not work. the bell guy assured us the front desk made a mistake. and she did she actually wrote down the incorrect room number on the key card cover.after finally getting into the correct room, my 4 year old son pointed out the green stains on the duvet. we noticed the stains were fresh and continued onafter checking in we discovered there was no swimming pool which we were disappointed since we brought our kids. the manager also agreed that amex travel website was very misleading with a picture of a swimming pool under the loews atlanta hotel page.we went to our room and our room key didn‚äôt work, the receptionist had sent us to the wrong room. the key didn‚äôt work so the bell boy opened our door and we seen only one bed no view. when we reserved two double beds with city view. eventually the receptionist realized she had written down the wrong room number.when we eventually got into the correct room, my 4 year old son noticed some green stains on the duvet. after waiting 40 minutes the cleaners arrived to change the bedding. the stains were also on the walls and wall lamp. my husband took pictures. i might also add that the guest services were non apologetic for this incident.the lamp shades in the rooms were very old and had water stains. we tried to remain positive for the remainder of our stay. we ordered food from in room dining and the food and service was excellent. jennifer did an excellent job.however on our last night ‚äòjennifer‚äô did not bring us hot boiling water as we had requested. we waited an hour before i called again asking her please to bring hot water to the room to warm my baby‚äôs bottle even through she could clearly hear my baby crying in the background. my husband called a third time and she put him on hold. i thought this was the tip of the iceburg and very mean of anyone to do this. i still do not understand this. so instead i had to run the hot water tap from the bathroom over the bottle for 45 mins to warm the bottle. also what hotel does not have a microwave in the room?! also this is listed in their amenities on their website!we did not report this incident to the manager as we felt it would have gone uncared for anyways, since we didn‚äôt not receive any apology for the room mix up nor the stains in the room. we did not want to annoy ourselves further.one more thing, each morning the pipes in the bathroom behind the shower sounded like the were about to explode. the rattling and shaking of pipes. my (due to water pressure i take it) was unbearable. my husband found out that by turning on our shower would help with the noise which it did. i also have a video of this banging sound! it honestly was a bit like faulty towers.all in all loews was way below expectation. i do not believe this is a 4 star hotel, it falls behind standard. however the food was excellent. we even made a point to call guest services to compliment them on their food.bell boy and valet all very professional and friendly.guest services was terrible, the fact the lady never brought us some hot water after waiting for so long and especially for a baby bottle. absolutely unacceptable.overall we unfortunately will not be back.i spend a week in lowes miami 2 months ago. it was excellent.i did a staycation on lowes atlanta. everything went fine till two days after the checkout when i was charged an extra $379.75i called the hotel and was told it was due to a smoking fee. my wife and i have never smoked in our lives and will never smoke.funny thing is that the manager marcel has not yet returned any update on my inquiry for a week already. he is still waiting on the house keeping management. how can that be??also, i booked my stay with amex platinum fhr and was awarded check-out at 4pm.house keeping knocked at my door 3 times asking when i was going to check out. sounds like they were in a hurry to go home. i left at 4pm. 2 days later i got this exorbitant smoking fee.what out when staying at loews atlanta, specially if you have late check out. ask a manager to go see your room before departing.sold as a luxury property, the service is anything but...the recent renovation is beautiful. the lobby is chic, smartly decorated, warm and inviting. aesthetically the the hotel is a winner. however, the staff is woefully undertrained and the level of service leaves much to be desired.the rooms are not well cleaned. for three straight days, the shampoo and conditioner was not replaced, white the used, empty tubes, discarded on the shower floor, sat there untouched. there are stains on the carpet in my premium\" room and the bath mat is frayed around the edges.i was in my room on an important conference call, when housekeeping knocked for turn down service. unanswered, the knocking persisted, turned into banging, until finally i had to hold the call to attend to the maid service. shouldn't they be attending to me?my restrictive dietary requests were met with antagonism by the in-room dining host. though a creation of avocado, beans, and other interesting ingredients was finally offered, a $22.00 lettuce and tomato salad was delivered. when i called to question what went wrong, missing ingredients promised to be brought to my room, never showed up.sleep deprived, due to the old or cheap, too soft mattress, i finally fell into deep rem, only to be brutally awoken by an accidentally pulled fire alarm at 4 am on the second night of my visit. groggy, pajama clad guests, wandered the hall wondering what to do. the front desk didn't answer our calls and i was halfway down the 26 fights of stairs before an all clear message came across the loud speaker. i never heard a word of recognition or apology for the incident.the front desk staff is mostly curt or otherwise uninformed. trying to track down the rental car that went with the keys left for me at the front desk was like a scavenger hunt and the next day i had to pry a parking card, which is suppose to come with the room, from the annoyed front desk clerk who clearly had better things to do then help me.with all the choices atlanta has to offer, choose another hotel. try the four seasons. the beds are dreamy and their staff is wonderful!\"formally requested quiet room. was given a lovely, quiet room -- except -- that early, early in the morning each day of our three day stay, we were jolted from bed because of construction (remodeling) in the room above us. truly it was jackhammering of tile, and sawing and drilling - we thought it was a fire alarm at first, and this noise continued until 5 pm each day. the hotel did not disclose this construction. and while they did give us coupons for a free breakfast at the restaurant - they did not refund our money nor offer us a good night's sleep. the desk staff clearly knew about the construction, and clearly had had many complaints before, but again - never told me - as i checked in - specifically confirming that it would be a quiet room. other aspects of this hotel are vey nice.we stayed at the loews for a weekend wedding. the stay at loews was a nightmare. on our first night there, at 2:00am, my wife and i were awakened to someone apparently breaking into our room. i jumped out of bed as the door closed and went in the hall to see what was going on. i saw someone, who appeared to be a security guard, and asked him what was going on. he said i'm sorry\" and continued walking. the next morning, the front desk, after checking into my story, indicated there was a noise complaint and the security person apparently went into the wrong room. as you can imagine, it was the scariest things my wife and i have ever experienced.the next day we left the room at 10:am returning at 3:30. our room wasn't cleaned yet but the person in the hall said she would get to it. we left the room for an hour and it never happened. when we left the hotel for the evening we told the front desk our room hadn't been cleaned yet and she assured us it would be cleaned. when we came back at 10;oopm it still wasn't cleaned. we again mentioned it to the front desk. they finally cleaned the room later that evening. unlikely i will ever stay at a loews again.\"made a reservation to stay here months in advance for husbands 50th birthday. as fate would have it, the vice president had a function there and that changed everything!separate from the disastrous dynamics of trying to get to the hotel across all of the barricades, i called the hotel and spoke with valet to verify that they had parking services and we would not be turned away because of street shut downs. i was told to approach on the backside and enter the garage there.all of the parking (and i do mean all) of the parking was restricted, largely to valet, some to retail residents, the hotel had about 40 spots (woefully poor offering for a hotel of this size).we couldn‚äôt find the valet (who directed ya to enter on this side, we parked the car ourselves in one of their spots and recorded the number to tell them).finally got into the lobby, spoke to somebody in valet who went out to talk to the drivers while we went to check in. we were at the front desk (an hour and a half after check in) only to be told that they didn‚äôt have any rooms ready and we (along with hundreds of other people) would be waiting in a lobby that couldn‚äôt accommodate the masses. we were told this was because the vice president was visiting.to top it all off - valet came to us while we were trying to check in to tell us that what they had told us before on the phone was wrong and that i now needed to get my car out of the back entrance garage and drive it around to the other side (which was blockaded) somehow.we left.this is a hotel one would expect superior service at, in all honesty, they fell on their face. they were horribly prepared for the logistics of how to accommodate what they undertook and were anything but apologetic to their guests who were paying a generous sum to stay there.will never book at a loews again!!!! ever!!!!both times i was told my room wasn‚äôt available & they would have to move my party of 4 into a king bed room. a roll away bed is still not an option for 4 people. i waited 45 mins to speak with manageri not only experienced horrible service but i witnessed it throughout the weekend! i have no intentions of ever returning and i'm also going to forward this feedback to nuvo in hopes that they can find another suitable location that knows how to treat their guests! there is no apology large enough to compensate me for how i was treated! quite honestly, i‚äôve experienced better service at the holiday inn than i received at the loews this weekend!for three years we have stayed here for the convenience of being in the same place as convention is held. every year this hotel is not prepared for the amount of people they have checking in. they overbook and then you have to figure out what to do because the staff does not seem able or willing to help. this will be my last bad experience here-will go across the street for less money and better service.i was so thrilled to spend our anniversary at loews after hearing friends talk about nice the hotel is but i guess we caught them on a off day. my husband and i arrive at the hotel at 530pm, greeted by nice valet gentleman then we walk to the check in desk and not one attendant even looked up at us or even welcomed us to loews since they were too busy on cellphones. we finally got checked in to a corner room on the 18th floor. average room with little view of downtown and stains in the carpet. i called down to ask if we could have another room with a better view and was told no. very disappointed when i let the hotel know prior about our big day. the only great part about the stay was the restaurant for breakfast the next day and the sweet ladies in the starbucks. i may consider loews for a future stay but hope the service gets better throughout the hotel.booked the loews as it was a top rated ta hotel. the bar really can‚äôt be that low in atl. we arrived late and were told our 2 bed room was not available. i reserved the room as i was traveling with my adult son. the ‚äúupgraded‚äù room had one bed, so they had to bring a rollaway. it was like sleeping on a board. was told we might get the room we originally booked today. no trust in loews, first and last stay in loews property, moving to the ritz carlton today, know what to expect there.looking for a lovely hotel to stay in midtown? this is not it. for the price you will pay, the service and the staff will treat you as if your mere existence is an inconvenience to them. from the front desk staff, to the valets and the door staff and the bell staff, any time you come or go you will put yourself in a position to be rushed, be spoken to in raised voices or treated as though you missed the sign that said don't bother us.\" we stayed at the hotel for a wedding because it's proximity to the venue was impeccable. everyone in our party at one point or another during the wedding weekend complained about their treatment by the staff. so much so that the bride called her group contact and was immediately placated by the group coordinator. if you have ever attended a wedding or are married yourself, it speaks volumes to the experience when the bride feels as if she must constantly apologize for the treatment of her guests. once again, if you are looking for a lovely hotel to stay in midtown atlanta, may i suggest you go next door to the w. there you will be treated better.\"hotel great- not so great: prepaying on your site and booked through travelocity -arrived at 10pm- was supposed to meet friends---there was no reservation - hotel would not assist even though i showed my confirmation email. had to call travelocity twice- long wait- long calls twice - to people i could barely understand. and,after 2 hours - a fax arrived. i missed my dinner plans with friends (which is the only reason i drive here) i should get a refund. going back to expediathe traffic noise was very loud all night long, even being on the 11th floor it was impossible to sleep. cars, trucks, harleys, sirens- you name it, they roared by constantly with no period of quiet at all. i'm tired! even earplugs didn't help!my best friend & i arrived at the hotel friday night just after 10pm, tired and ready for bed. when we got to our room, she a disgusting stain that was probably bodily fluid on her comforter. she called the front desk expecting an apology and an offer to make it right. dissatisfied with the response, she then went down to the lobby to talk to someone face-to-face. she returned to the room & told me the front desk rep did not apologize or offer any compensation, but would send someone would come change the linen.after twenty minutes of waiting, i finally went to the shower and she called downstairs again. from the bathroom i could hear voices about 10 minutes later. the original person who spoke to my friend in the lobby, (who offered no apology for the dirty linen) had not reported the complaint to anyone, and that is why it took 40 minutes for anyone to come to the room. the guy who come up didn‚äôt know how to change the linen , and my friend, who had been up since 6am was beside herself. finally a nice lady name ms. sara came up and moved us to the same room on a higher floor of the hotel, she apologized, a full hour after calling the front desk, we were finally able to go to bed. i am shocked that we were not offered a complimentary night or at least a breakfast for our trouble.i really wanted to like this hotel and make permanent home of frequent atlanta business trip but it failed miserably.3 device wifi policy - you can connect to 3 device - total. in my 6 day stay attending conference, i had to log in to 4th account, that disconnected all my devices, i had to be on call with outsourced 3rd party customer service to reset my account, where i was warned if it happened again they going make me pay penalty of $15.00 to reset. btw, they can see devices, activity traffic, ip and mac addresses of the devices.breakfast - it takes 1 and hour with 4 active tables. they are extremely inefficient and you can almost bet they will get your order wrong.business office - you have to authenticate yourself, well it didn't work. system did not recognize my or my colleagues - no one to help you through out office. this is simply not business or leisure friendly hotel.the front desk, concierge and hotel convenient store staff were amazingly hospitable. they also have a communications system that allows the the front desk to text you instead of calling. for example, they sent me a text to ask if the room is okay after check-in, as an alternative to the usual call from the front desk.what set the staff apart was a charm and personality that you cannot script. when thinking back on this hotel, i will always think of the staff i interacted with and think of them as uniquely georgian\".the \"fatal flaw\" was an experience that impacted my comfort, in my room, for the entire stay.after check-in and placing my luggage upstairs, i went out to dinner. not wanting to miss a \"must have\" opportunity but full from dinner, i bought a $9 slice of cheesecake to bring home and enjoy the next day. after returning to my room, i discovered what at first glance looked like a mini refrigerator, was actually a \"smart\" minibar. i called downstairs asking if there would be an issue placing my slice of cake in the fridge. i was told that as long as nothing was removed it would be fine. i slid the slice right on top of two cans of heineken.i left my room the next day and was out for 10 hours. i returned to find that housekeeping had removed my slice of cheesecake from the fridge and placed it on the writing desk to spoil.i lost trust in the hotel for the care and keeping of my personal items at that point, as i thought it reasonable to assume the staff member knew the consequences of removing fresh food from its refrigerated environment. i no longer had confidence that my other personal items would be treated with the same care as i would treat them. i also felt that there was more that they could of done, least of all send me a text of apology and let me know.although i stayed two more nights, i asked that no one enter my room after that experience and took care of my own room.\"the property was clean, bright and modern. rooms were spacious and comfortable. staff was incredible and constantly asking if they could be of service (michael hill was an unbelievable concierge!)the restaurant was understaffed early saturday morning, but sunday mid-morning was a disaster! six or seven wedding guest blocks\" for the weekend, the place was packed, and the $25 buffet had one omelette cook and no other egg choice on the buffet. a poor experience at a wonderful hotel. perhaps they think they needn't try since cafe intermezzo is next door...\"the parking was the only thing confusing . i really liked the rooms . i would not recommend asking the valet drivers for directions . we wanted to have dinner at the seafood restaurant 1 block away he sad it was up the street never told us to turn right at the corner .i am currently stating at the hotel on business. i left my room at 8:30am this morning and just got back to my room, 7:30pm. it hasn't been cleaned. i call the 'star service' line and am told that housekeeping has left for the day and would i like new towels. i ask if this should be expected and she replies housekeeping is only here 8-5:30pm daily, they don't always have time to get to all the rooms.\"i am pretty sure this is not the level of service to expect at a loews.and also walls are super thin, had to call security last night at 2am due to loud guests in neighboring rooms.\"self service parking is easy and even when the parking kiosk accidentally charged us, the front desk was quick to refund us with no questions asked. our concierge, robert, was very professional and understanding.customer service and hospitality was outstanding!!! food was delicious!!! room was cozy and clean . the car service was fast and reliable!!! most places we wanted to go was within a 3 mile radius of the hotel!!!thanks robert holliday, jena and paul for all your graciousness!!!!this is now my go-to\" hotel in atlanta. my husband forgot his diabetic supplies and the hotel driver took him to the nearest pharmacy and even waited on him while he got what he needed. disaster averted.\"the loews chain of high-end hotels has a reputation for quality. unfortunately, the quality control was not up to its usual high standards. when i checked in, the room had lamps unplugged, the tv disconnect, and the radio/clock set to a time not close to the correct hour or minute. i called star service\" and a maintenance person was sent up who corrected (almost) everything. unfortunately, the radio/clock was left set to alarm at 2am. the next day when i returned to the room, housekeeping had left a dust mop behind. further, the hotel was experiencing a system-wide outage of most of the tv channels (which they could only partially fix before the next day).hotel staff were responsive and polite; however, quality issues make an unfortunate impression.i'm still here for a few more days, so i'll update this post (+/-) as the saga continues.\"first of ten hotels we stayed at during a recent 3 week tour of the southern states. a luxurious hotel but very expensive. valet parking only at $56 a night, small glass of wine and a beer nearly $20. our room overlooked the main road and traffic noise was constant and intrusive.we stayed 3 nights at the loews atlanta hotel. the receptionist at check-in was very courteous and the bell captain was very nice and greeted us every time we returned to the hotel. that's about the extent of the positive experience we had here. the room was nice and clean and the bed was pretty comfy, but it wasn't any nicer than a decent marriott, was much more expensive (about $300/night), and included far less amenities. we were, overall, pretty disappointed in our stay here. hotel policies are built to nickel and dime you to death. the only way this place isn't a ripoff is if you're here for a business conference and the company paying the tab is writing it off on taxes anyway. we needed to print a voucher for the citypass we purchased before our arrival, and when i asked concierge for help i was told, i can't do anything about that. you need to find the business center.\" ok, where's the business center? he replies dismissively, \"floor c. you'll find it,\" as if he didn't have time to deal with my questions. i'm pretty sure it's your job as concierge to provide the information or services requested of you. once i found the business center with no direction, (which took a minute because i went left off the elevator instead of right first because there was an active conference happening that we didn't want to interrupt. it also happened to be essentially the same room where the \"business center\" is located.) i soon discovered that simply turning the computer on costs $6. printing the 3 page document i needed was $0.69/pg. for b&w, totaling just over $8 for $0.30 worth of prints at any print shop. the room service was lauded for being available 24hrs a day. we never tried it because in addition to being about 300% overpriced, there is a 22% \"service charge\" plus $4 \"delivery charge\" which makes the $25 \"star service breakfast\" actually cost $34.50 per person. charge $25 for breakfast, fine. it's pretty overpriced, but i'm ok with that for good food delivered to my door. charge normal price plus service and delivery charge, ok i guess. to do both is asinine. i'm not paying $70 for a 2 person breakfast when the flying biscuit or broken egg cafe are a couple blocks or less away for less than half the money and double the quality and quantity of food. i don't know if parking was included or not as we rode marta from the airport, but i seriously doubt it... in the future we will choose a different hotel. i understand paying for service, and i don't mind doing so when i can see the value of the money i'm spending, but i won't be beaten over the head with unwarranted charges and fees as a guest in your hotel.\"we booked the grand king room with the redefining romance\" package the night of our wedding (since our honeymoon is a month away). i called twice confirming the reservation, however, upon checking in (after our wedding), we were told the rooms were sold out were upgraded to the grand suite at no charge.after entering the room, we quickly realized that the \"redefining romance\" didn't happen - a few minutes later, the front desk called realizing their error, and asked when we'd leave so that they could correct their mistake. while we appreciated their effort - it was extremely disappointing having to leave the room right after our wedding! we told the front desk we'd leave around 6pm and they said they'd have everything ready. when we returned around 11pm (we went back to visit our family), the rose petal turn down service was done, but there were no chocolate covered strawberries or champagne. i called the star service, who transferred me to the concierge, who transferred me to in house dining who then finally transferred me to the front desk - 20 minutes later, we had the rest of the romance package. after a full day of wedding activities, it was really too late to enjoy.from the website, the grand king is described as \"these corner rooms have wraparound, floor-to-ceiling windows with breathtaking views of the city and stone mountain.\" we got suite 928, whose \"breathtaking\" view was of the dickey broadcasting building across the street and its occupants looking directly at us - we promptly closed the blinds as there was nothing breathtaking about it.overall all the people were very nice, however the above service was terrible (you shouldn't have to worry about any of this on your wedding night). to top it off, they don't even have a pool!at $289 for the grand king + romance package - this definitely wasn't worth it - save your money and go to another hotel.\"i've stayed for the past 2 years at the ritz, what a mistake! the loewes is by far the best,from its design to high level service! the cheese and meat platters are to die for! deliciousspecial thanks to jack the doorman, he was tremendous! :)my wife and i decided to stay in nice hotel to get away for a weekend. we booked a room at this hotel for around $250ish a night. we get there and self park. we waited about 5-10 minutes to check in which wasn't too terrible. after the person checks us in, i asked about parking because the ticket to get into the garage said $16 for 24 hours. i didn't know if i needed to keep the ticket. i was told to throw it away\" and the hotel would take care of it.we get to our room and it was the most average hotel room i have ever stayed in. literally like a holiday in express. our \"view\" was of another building a bunch of air conditioning units. the room was a bed, tv, small table, and bathroom. the bathroom had a separate shower and tub and like a 9 inch television over the tub. there were pretty disgusting stains around the toilet where it looked like something had been spilled. we were extremely disappointed and decided to leave and walk to go eat.we got back after dinner and i opened my computer and connected to the complimentary wifi.....which was unusable. 3mpbs download and .5 mbps upload. to get any speed, its another $15 a day. we just went to bed. the next morning i got up and spoke to the concierge about a place to fly a drone and they rudely said, \"uh, the park\". at this point, i wasn't shocked and was ready to check out and leave this place.we get ready to check out and i ask again about parking and they said we will be billed $28 on our credit card. i was shocked because it was actually more than just paying the parking deck. they actually charged me more. they also tried to charge me $18 for two bottled waters. apparently when i opened the fridge and moved one to see what was in there, they charge you. something about sensors for movement. whatever.i would highly suggest the four seasons a block or two down the road. this place is extremely overpriced for what it is. i can't vouch for the suites, which may be amazing. if you are reserving a standard room, do not stay here. rude concierge, scammy front desk person, and below average, dirty rooms.we wasted our money and will not be back to this hotel.\"one of the three nights we stayed the room was not cleaned at all. bed was unmade, wet towels not changed, no toilet paper or tissues, no water or coffee, etc. in addition, the room service order was incorrect both mornings.was in atlanta with spouse who was there on business. overall we had a wonderful experience and everything about this hotel, including the food, service, staff and amenities was exceptional except for the bedding. we were in a king on the 18th floor and the mattress and pillows were awful and need to be replaced. the mattress sagged into the middle and the pillows were flat. needless-to-say we didn't get very good sleep or rest which affected our overall stay. had it not been for this issue i would have given this review 5 stars.my daughter booked this block of rooms for her wedding weekend. as the mother of the bride, i should have had a seamless check in at 1am, as i was the only one there, but did not. i was given the wrong room, charged full price for a lesser room, and got a big run around on the phone the next day when i had a full day of events. i ended up with a $50 credit, a room change, a free bottle of wine and some parking comped, but the way i was made to feel on a special weekend was unforgivable. i should not have had to ask for compensation if customer service was their number 1 priority. i am not a high maintenance person, but i do expect quality at a high end hotel. the beds are uncomfortable, and when i got to the right room the next afternoon, one of the bed skirts was soiled like someone dropped a coke on it. also, an extra fee of $100 per day is held on your credit card for incidentals which i was not told about upon check-in.the hotel met my expectations but did not exceed them. i just received a review from the hotel about my stay and while i filled it out i realized they consider themselves a luxury hotel and that experience was not delivered to us. this being said i may come back if in the area but would not seek it out. there were two things that happened that really makes them miss the mark the first being much smaller then the second. firstly at check in the girl asked me how many room keys i wanted and i told her two. i was unaware and given just one. my next trip through the lobby i went back up to the front desk and waited in a short line then asked for another key. the woman remembered me and said i knew you would need two keys. it was friendly enough and i thought to myself i asked for two and you gave me one, and now i have to wait for the second one due to a line.\" the second issue again due to how it played out not s huge deal, but could have been. at one point in our stay before we went to dinner around 6:30 i went to wash my hands and the hot water did not turn on. nothing came out of the faucet, almost like the water was turned off but i could hear air moving after about a minutes i turned it off and when we left we talked to someone up front and asked them to fix the problem before we returned. it was fixed and that was a small problem. it would have been big if it were 7:00 when wanted to shower. also as a luxury hotel i feel that someone should have called me during our stay or at check out. just to say sorry for the inconvenience, but it didn't happen.\"recently stayed here for a friends wedding where we received a wedding party rate. booked 2 rooms for 4 people. they didn't clean either room, tried to charge us for a bottle of water that was moved off the non-disclosed sensor and never seemed to care. room service had a delivery charge and a service charge and a line for a gratuity. $10 bowl of pasta with butter cost me $22! it may look really nice in the lobby but i'd rather stay at a hampton inn where i get treated nicely and get a free breakfast and coffee!!!from the very beginning of this stay... to the final minutes....perfection! i am a huge customer service observer.... and the staff here was the very best. our waitress, recognized is the second and brought us our drinks immediately without us asking.... gave us tons of helpful tourist tips, got us maps...etc...the gal at check in, bryanna, was funny and efficient...great at her job.... and then there is abdul... the hotel driver... i walked out to grab a cab... and he said...no worries..i'll drive you there\"... really?? are you kidding..... and he did! brought me to the shopping area i wanted, gave me his card so i could call him when i was ready to come back! seriously! awesome service. i'll only stay at loews whenever i visit this beautiful city. bravo!\"i would like to give a personal shout out\" to the best \"up front\" person at the desk ever with having kala as the receptionist!!!!!!' how lucky is the hotel to have such a fabulous person there to welcome their guests!!!!!!!! thank you kala. for being so good at your job!!!!! we love you!!! all the bar mitzvah folks of the rosenberg klan!!!!!!\"dear sirs,my expectations were a lot higher than my actual experience of visiting loews atlanta.at first, after checking in i needed to go find the bellman, because there was nobody to handle my four pieces of luggage at 10pm nothing funny at all.next day, i invited three businessmates for breakfast and i found out that your cafeteria was not as good as you huge and glamorous party bar, as a matter of fact i felt dissappointed. hhad i known, i would rather invited them other place.in my way back to the hotel at 10pm, i needed to go find the valet driver because, i guess for codl weather, he kept the door closed in front of the valet counter, it was again no funny at all specially after waiting five minutes in that weather, i finally left my car unatteded, while the frontdesk people were watching and offer no assistance.on my last day at 11am, i was working on my computer, and i kindly asked for a one hour extention of my check out time, offcourse i didn't get it at all, instead i got half an hour and a knot at my door al 12 sharp.finally at check out, i comment to a lady working there about my expectations of having a extra hour, and her answer was were are bookoutwell that was it, i will try not to return again at loews atlantamy stay was from february 29 to march 3rd, 2016we stayed at loews for the weekend. we upgraded to a suite, so we paid roughly double for the room. we requested a crib, no crib was ever brought to our room, i requested the newspaper in the mornings no newspaper was ever brought. the room was fairly clean and comfortable, with the exception of the bathroom sink. the overflow hole was black of mold which you could clearly see in the mirror. the walls are pretty thin, i could hear everything from the room above and beside me, especially when they turned on the water! this was a overall clean hotel, but lacked the quality you would expect for the price.the hotel was fine. i actually prefer going to the w hotels myself, however i heard that loews was a great hotel. i agree. a great hotel. was treated quite nicely by the staff inside of the hotel. however, my first impression of the hotel was not as great due to the attitude and lack of attention from the valet staff outside. i was not acknowledged while sitting in front of the valet staff who stared at my car for five minutes. after i checked out, no one approached me for my ticket and the number on the ticket was also incorrect. my opinion...from just that alone...don't expect much from (valet ronald) if you don't drive a bmw.my stay at the loews atlanta was absolutely wonderful. the hotel is beautiful and in a great location in midtown, close to restaurants and a park. as someone else mentioned, the hotel and area is very accommodating for travel with a dog, and there are ample walking spaces nearby. the hotel staff were all friendly and helpful, and i was impressed by how well they remembered guests. my room was spectacular and offered tons of space, i had a corner suite on a high floor. i will be returning to the hotel on my next trip to atlanta.the staff were very friendly and helpful, our room was beautiful. the midtown location wonderful with many restaurants, the high museum, and a large park within easy walking distance. the area is very accommodating for travel with a dog, and there are ample walking spaces nearby. the hotel staff were all friendly and helpful, and i was impressed by how well they remembered guests and their preferences. food was excellent too. i will be coming back.loews atlanta has an upscale modern feel in the heart of atlanta. it was close to a lot of things. the rooms were clean and comfortable but nothing special. there was a separate tub that looked plenty large for a typical person but not large enough for couples. our view was not great but when you are surrounded by other tall building, there's not much else to look at. we did not eat there but hotel staff was nice. if it were not for the location, i would not have paid as much as i did for the room.my stay in the hotel itself was great. the valet on the other hand was a horrible experience in my opinion. we called down before we checked out to have them go ahead and pull my car around. we waited several additional minutes after we got down there. when we sat down in my car, it smelled like someone had thrown up in it. it also smelled like burnt clutch. we rode around the rest of the day with the windows down. i don't know what happened to my car, and i'm not sure i want to.the place was really gorgeous until i discovered old french fries under the bed, red stain on headboard, and my pillow was dirty. other than that, everything is walking distance for you to have a wonderful time.i'm actually sitting in my room right now. we arrived yesterday and our room was on the 17th floor. the hallway literally smelled like a skunk sprayed it. thankfully, the room did not smell the same. it was nice. except for the big clump of hair in the shower. someone from housekeeping was in the hall and cleaned it. after we came back from dinner, we were relaxing in the room when we heard noise coming from the vent. it sounded like a sit-com, getting loud, laughing, etc. there was no room next to us so it was not the neighbors t.v.. by 8:30, it hadn't stopped and we called the desk. they were sending an engineer. two hours later.....no engineer. we were tired. called again....no engineer. called again and asked for a room change. new room: smelled strongly of smoke and spray to cover it. went to the desk. sorry for the inconvenience, here's tickets for a free breakfast and we are upgrading your room.\" third room; not an upgrade. they didn't have one clean and didn't tell us. this room had the same problem with the vent but in addition, now we were 7 floors down and that noise was competing with the street noise. finally, at 11:30 p.m., we were sent to the original 'upgraded' room. same as all the others, just a higher floor. thankfully, no vent noise. we found the upgrade: one small bottle of water on the nightstand. three hours to resolve this problem. no, i would not stay here again.\"overall, a 4-star hotel in midtown worth the price tag. room was clean; only blemish i noticed was some cracking of the paint in bathroom ceiling due to moisture. front desk was prompt in switching room after first assigned room had an odor. sad my gift from the concierge service was not transferred to the new room. only problem was failure of room service; error in one order and failure to bring door hanger to allow for morning breakfast service after requested twice. gym is contains wonderful classes!please! late check out on the sunday of 4th of july weekend not allowed. i am sure you had very few guests waiting for rooms. while it is a very nice hotel, they had charges on the in room snacks and had not checked. it is too easy to miss two candy bars and two pringles on a bill. how many people get charged and do not complain. not a high classed thing to do.my 21yr old son & i stayed at loews over the weekend based on tripadvisor ranking & reviews. based on our stay i can't recommend this hotel. yes they have valet ($35 per night! not sure where they park the cars but it takes forever.) i get $20-$25 but $35 seems egregious. the check in staff was pleasant ( i checked in at 10:30 at night so i had their full attention) cool bar area with decent priced drinks ( received 2 complimentary drinks as part of my reservation). rooms - very basic. i reserved & stayed in a grand corner rm. & really wasn't impressed. we get to the rm at 10:40 pm - no bottled water. really!! empty mini fridge & no fridge to cool drinks. there's an ice machine right outside my rm & we are now prepared to drink tap water. go to the ice machine - no ice - it's broken! i place a call to star service to order a bucket of ice & inform them about the broken machine. 30 min later no ice delivery. my son orders rm service ( chicken noodle soup, cesar salad & 2 waters - reminds them to bring ice) . rm service was prompt. better than average quality food but for $65 inc tip - really not worth it. to top the night off - the safe door is locked so no where to store valuables. the weekend was great but for the $$ we could of had a much better stay at another hotel. i wont be back.there was a problem on my bill - we paid for parking separately and it showed up on the room bill anyway. that happens sometimes. but i called the customer service number included in the guest bill email and left a message. it was never returned. so then i sent an email to the email included in the guest bill email on may 31. it was never returned. so i sent a second on june 5, that was also never returned. i finally called the front desk and was transferred to billing, where i had to leave another message. that was finally returned on june 8. and then they told me they needed to see a receipt to remove the parking charges. of course, by then, more than two weeks later, i don't have a receipt, so now i have to deal with my credit card company to provide proof. all avoidable if basic levels of post stay customer service had been provided. they were not.stayed here for a weekend for a wedding i was going to in atl. was a nice hotel in a good location walking distance to many restaurants and bars. no real complaints. a little pricey but you get what you pay for.recently i booked a surprise weekend stay for my girlfriend and i at the loews atlanta. i have to say that my stay was really only so so. there seemed to be a real problem with the cooling of the room staying warm to almost hot at times. i made several complaints at the front desk and received no improvement.no one offered to move us to remedy the situation other than saying they would send someone up. all they ended up doing was adjusting to lovers in the vent but the cooling never improved.not sure i will be staying at the loews in the near future with other options available.i'm not the type to write bad reviews, but after coming back from a weekend with bites made me do so. beautiful hotel, lobby, and rooms with a great view. i stayed mother's day weekend and still trying to battle these bites on my stomach, thighs, & buttocks. this is kinda like the worst experience i've ever had at a hotel and this was supposed to be a 5 star\" hotel. disappointed customer! the amenities were great but i would recommend some type of deep cleansing/renovation to remove some issues.\"while our stay was lovely and the room appeared to be clean, i left with bites all over my stomach and both my arms. appears they have bed bugs!!!! was there with a large group of friends for a wedding and am not the only one who returned home with bites! the best part is when another bite victim called to ask about her bites they admitted to having bed bugs !!! very disappointed, first time to atlanta, certainly not my last, but bed bugs?!!!! disgusting.... and so very itchy. last time at loews atlanta hotel in midtown for me.i have stayed here on business getting anywhere from 3 to 9 rooms at a time. we got there at 10pm and the premier room that we paid over $400 for was not ready. we made the decision to let our clients stay there once it was ready and we went to another hotel. the rewards program is useless. they go by stays so that $15,000 i spent when i had 9 rooms means nothing. it counts as 1 stay. when we spend that kind of money we are catered to by the front desk and managers but not here. they are phoney managers! i will stick with my starwood properties. they give use gifts on arrival and they have floors for their starwood guests and points accumulate fast so i get free nights or use cash and and points.we have stayed at most of the 'brand' hotels at one time or another, and by in large they are fine. however, loews atlanta provides an experience which makes the compitition look like interns. the facility, but more pointedly the staff, was extraordinary!! could not recommend this hotel more highly.in town for my best friends wedding. shocked to find in our bedside stand, a sex toy, and other personal items from previous guest. all i can say is it totally grossed me out! what really disappointed me the most was the way it was handled when i brought it to the attention of the front desk. they offered to upgrade me on my next stay...i am not staying there again!we loved this loews! great location -- concierge is top notch!!! room was very comfortable and very clean. the staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable! great stay!!! exactly what you would expect from loews!!the rooms are nice and clean, but nothing better than you'd get from a marriott courtyard. be prepared for a lobby that turns into a blaring loud disco on saturday nights with cars backed up the street waiting for valet parking. i felt insulted when the hotel restaurant told us they could not accommodate a table for six for breakfast!. are you kidding??? i thought it was a joke but they suggested our group sit at two tables! the hotel seems designed to extract the maximum amount of money with minimal effort on their part, for example: $1.00 room-to-room calls, $1.00 per page to print in their business center (most hotels provide this free), or $6 bottles of water in the rooms. what really turned me off is the staff has a much higher opinion of themselves and the hotel in general then they warrant. i've stayed at four and five star properties around the world, and this definitely isn't one of them.the staff are very nice. however, upon arrival my party and i were informed that self-parking was free. as my friend does not like others to drive her car, she parked it in the unattached loews parking garage. it turns out it is 24$ a night, despite being told otherwise. along with this, the website made no mention of 100$ charge in case of incidentals at time of check in. the young lady at the check in counter did not tell me it was 100$ *per night*. oversights like this happen but when i called in regards to the charge for parking, i was promised a return call as i requested a return of the amount taken due to being told something different. i've yet to receive a call or compensation - all i would like is the parking refunded and an apology for the apparent miscommunication.let me start by saying, i've stayed in a number of hotels, from cheap to extravagant, even used to have a travel job and i've not had this type of experience. i was visiting atl for a wedding last weekend. we got in late friday night, checked in. i used the toilet and found that it would not flush. we had to get something to eat so i called the star service and told them we had a problem. they said they would send someone up. when we got back it was about 2 a.m. i noticed that the toilet paper had been removed from the toilet and put in the trash but i thought that the person might have removed the paper before they began working, so at 2 in the morning i wasn't going to press. however, that's kind of gross. saturday morning, we get up late and i use the bathroom, the toilet seemed to work slow and we had to maneuver but we thought it was fixed. then my boyfriend used it, flushed, closed the lid, then went to work out. when i went to use it, there were floating boats in the toilet, i called star service again and the gentleman came up plunged and replaced a part and said it was fixed. i noticed it still appeared slow and i asked if we needed to hold the flusher down. he said that we did. yes, having to hold the flusher down at $150 per night seems off to me, the fact that i had to ask him if i need to hold the flusher really surprised me. i would've thought he could recognize that there was still an issue. so while i'm thinking this toilet is still a problem, i'm praying it will work because i don't want to have to change rooms at this point as we're in a rush to find a store and then get to the wedding. i'm also surprised they didn't offer a room change the night before.when we're heading out to the mall we realize the toilet isn't flushing again. yes the service person had left about an hour before. we stop at the front desk to tell them that the toilet still isn't working and this is report number 3. by now they offer to change us to another room. great!! we have to pack up and move before the wedding. so then we ask for some remuneration for having to deal with a faulty toilet and the experience of seeing stagnant boats in the toilet. they offer us an upgraded room or two free drinks at the bar. we ask for something more as this was really inconvenient for a two night stay. that was it. we took the upgraded room it was nice but our regular room was just as nice so for us that wasn't remuneration as we were at a night wedding so we didn't come in until late and it was our last night at the hotel. it wasn't like the room had a jacuzzi tub, just a few extra windows and a sofa. we were not impressed. the toilet worked fine in this room though. we explained this as we were checking out and asked for a discount on the room and they were unyielding.i was very disappointed with this experience and will not recommend a stay at this hotel. things happen, i could get past the toilet, but i expected a better response.this hotel has at least one doorman who, when asked for a taxi to the airport, directed the guests to an unregulated limo\" service instead. the driver was expecting more money to han the flat rate airport cab fare, and the guests discovered the \" mistake\" too late to hop out & get other service. shouldn't happen!\"in the end, as you customer you will be just 1 of many. the service and experience are average to sub-par compared to other hotels in the area. i wish i did not switch from the four seasons. many hotels in midtown to choose from. stay elsewhere.the staff at loews was outstanding !! my room was nice but the bed was not as comfortable as expected and the pillows were terrible. that being said i should have requested another room. i will give it another try when i return to atlanta.location, rooms and restaurant are top notch. staff is very accommodating. elevator banks are a little confusing and you may wind up in another section of the premises. no pool which is why i only gave it a four.we checked in at 4pm on saturday and waited 25 minutes to check in do to a large group of individuals checking in at the same time. the hotel was sold out so we couldn't upgrade our room to a larger room but we had the grand room with 2 double beds. there is plenty of room for queen beds so they need to upgrade that size. our toilet was broken upon check in and called for maintenance. we returned 3 hours later and they still hadn't come up but they did when i called again and demanded someone come fix it immediately. the iron was broken but we didn't know that until we tried using it right before checkout. there is road noise and we were on the 22nd floor but you are in a downtown area so we expected that.our company booked a room through a 3rd party for a colleague. his flight was cancelled due to the snow storm. we were stuck in atlanta because of this storm and wanted to use this already paid for by our company room. the staff did not let us because the reservation was under another name even though we had the credit card with us with which we paid! we were treated with indifference and there was no intention to help us out. people were stuck in traffic for more than12 hours and the only thing we heard was company policy states\".we will never book at this hotel any more that's for sure.adriaan\"hello,regarding our recent stay at the hotel i will mention a few things as to help improve loews brand. after we checked in i called down from the room 45 mins later to check on my bags. when the front desk operator said she would check on them i assumed she would. 20 more mins and no bags or call. i went down to lobby to see my bags sitting there with 3 bellmen doing nothing. i attempted to take them up my self but he insisted that i wasn't allowed. i understand that. the rooms furnature was fine in the bed room. the living room dining room area was off. the couch was to small for the room more like the size of a love seat; art missing from north wall and the dining table was very flimsy and wobbly; entry way had chocolate (i hope)spatter on the wallpaper near the floor of the west wall; i found a red paint spot (maybe nail polish on the bathroom floor. the seams around the crown molding in the bathroom were split and cracked in several places and need to be caulked. i found a long black hair in the tub. then he weirdest comment said to my friend (also staying at the hotel)from valet staff. my friend was smoking in the smoking area and the valet walked by and said in a strange somewhat judgmental tone. put that cancer in your lungs\". we stay at hotels often and live here in atlanta. we decided to stay at the loews so we could attend a party and then walk back to the room instead of driving back to buckhead last night. the cost of the stay was surprisingly inexpensive when i asked for a suite and now i understand why. underwhelmed by loews atlanta and somewhat offended by off color comments of staff, not a do over.james pupellodwight dixie cfoatlanta georgia\"i was very disappointed with the service i received at this hotel. to begin, they charge $400 to your credit card to hold for incidentals.\" while i understand most hotels take a credit card number for these purposes, i was not told how much would be held. when i noticed the charge i contacted the front desk and was told it would remain pending and then reverse when i checked out. not only did the charge post to my account, but after i checked out i was told it would take a week to be refunded. the only staff that really stood out to me were the doormen who were very friendly and helpful. the food at the hotel restaurant \"eleven\" is good but nothing special. not to mention that the $18 breakfast buffet they offer is almost identical to the free continental breakfasts you would receive at much cheaper hotels. overall, i think the hotel is very overrated and everything is way overpriced.\"...you might like this otherwise contemporary well appointed hotel. my experience is that the the clientele is more roadside budget inn than sophisticated traveler. obviously since this hotel is in the heart of lively midtown where partying goes on well beyond midnight in the immediate neighborhood and streets outside, you are not expecting an oasis in the middle of a desert. but, rowdy throngs of people yelling down the halls and partying outside your door is not an amenity to be proud of for a well established luxury hotel chain. want quiet - don't stay here. like partying as if it's collins avenue miami but without the ocean and beach, then you might like it.very convenient location. clean and modern. they allow dogs! staff is friendly and attentive. if you are staying longer then a week look for something else. most of the channels are analog and if you like sports don't plan to watch espn the hotel is so cheap that it can't even pay to watch college games? really. i'm staying here and just got told that the games on espn are blacked out here at hotel but, i can watch them next door on espn at the restaurant. save you money and stay at a marriott.we stayed as a family for a few nights in august 2013. the hotel is in a great midtown location with a really excellent fitness center and spa. the only thing that could really improve the hotel is having a swimming pool for the hot atlanta summer. we had two issues with the hotel: we arrived after a 16 hour flight from johannesburg and was told that the room category we had specifically booked ( a double room) was not available but we could pay more for an upgraded suite. totally disgusted. we made a fuss after our long flight and suddenly there was an available room at the rate which we had booked....... i find this totally unprofessional and unacceptable level of service. the other substandard service element was that there was no turndown service on the first night. again we complained and it was resolved by the second night. we ate breakfast at the hotel which was really excellent. midtown atlanta offers a vast choice of excellent hotels which would make me think twice about ever staying here again.my husband and i stayed in loews atlanta hotel on the 9th of july 2013. i choose this hotel because of good comments in tripadviser.the hotel is not so bad, thought cheaper rooms are better then the more expensive ones (they hace more space). this hotel is good for business.but the main problem we had with the stuff.when we checked in i wanted to pay cash, but the woman in the reception required a credit card. when i gave it she charged me amount two times more then we needed to pay.and when we checked out i didn‚äôt received my extra money back.when we were gone the hotel charged me the massage service that i didn‚äôt order for 135$ .i wrote the manager but they didn‚äôt answer me about this problem. they only checked my reservation and didn‚äôt help me with extra charges and receiving my money back (the total amount they have to return is 200$).be careful with the stuff, watch your money.yes this place has style, but it may be the least functional hotel room ever designed, with absolutely no mirror in the room. there is one in the bathroom and the hall has a mirror, but it is totally obstructed by the closet door and has no electric outlet or light close enough to use. so if someone is in the shower, the other person has to wait to put on makeup, or dry hair, or whatever. try getting ready for an event.there is music blaring from across the street until 2 or 3 am, loud and clear even on the upper floors. the hot water could not be adjusted in the sink, always too cold or hot. we advised the front desk of these issues and never got anything except an extension cord. they were more interested in checking the minibar at night to monitor usage, even though we did not even have a key to open it.then there is the cost of internet access, which gets higher if you use more than 2 devices. two phones and a laptop = $14.95 per day.i agree with the previous reviewers that this is a beautiful hotel and the front staff are very friendly. however, i had an experience here which made me feel unsafe. i had asked the concierge to have some toilet paper sent up to my room and, since i had the do not disturb sign on my door, to have them just put it outside and i would get it. ten minutes later i was drawing my bath and i heard the door open. someone had come in to my room while i was there and left the toilet paper. not only did they ignore the dnd sign, they had to actually remove it to open the door. and since the bathroom is adjacent to the door, i find it hard to believe that they did not hear the water running. i reported this to the concierge, who said that a manager would contact me. so far nothing. other people i work with said that this has happened to them at this hotel. all i can say is that, even if you have the dnd sign on your door, make sure you engage the interior lock because housekeeping will come in regardless.pros:central locationclean nicely furnished rooms with a good size bathroomfree self parkingcons:the night club next doors loud music wouldn't let me sleep although our room was on the 19th floor, i could hear the base in my pillow at-least untill 4 am!uncomfortable soft bed.front desk staff are uncooperative, i asked a lady to page the bell man because we called him 30 minutes before and he didn't come help with our 4 large bags we needed to catch a plane and she would not help! she had an attitude and would even print me the bill i had to ask her 3 times!we stayed in room 2509, on a friday evening. the night club on the opposite side of the street was so loud, that you could the vibration of the music in your room. the music was going until 3:30 am. not the relaxing weekend we were looking forward too. needless to say, i did not go to sleep until the night club shut down. the exhale spa was amazing though.my husband and i stayed here for a brief getaway on february 9, 2013. while we were greatly impressed by the outstanding valets and doorpersons and especially the front desk representative who checked us out (derale), we were not pleased with our stay overall.the representative who checked us in was nice, but her greeting and interaction with us did not come across as sincere. check-in was quick though, and in no time at all, we had received our letter describing what items were included with our suite seasons package - free internet, the room of course, a welcome amenity (later we discovered this item to be a small bottle of fiji water and three green apples which were included unceremoniously with our dining order), and a $50 dining credit.for the most part, my husband and i both thought the room furnishings were okay - the large bed, the attractive desk with two chairs and plenty of electrical outlets, two large flat screen televisions (and a great cable selection) plus the huge bathroom, i thought the suite would be two rooms divided by a door, but this room had only a divider between the living area and the bedroom (at least it was a sizable divider).what didn‚äôt impress either of us and left us hugely disappointed was the dust in the room (i was so shocked by this dust accumulation at a ‚äúluxury hotel‚äù that i have even included photos). i was happy i had my inhaler with me because this room looked like a miniature dust bowl had rolled through, with dust scattered on several of the tables and desks. it was so bad we even called the front desk and asked for someone to come up and clean the room.the person who answered the phone said she would send housekeeping up, but she didn‚äôt express any concern or make any type of apology for the state of the room. after housekeeping left, we did not receive a follow-up call from the front desk. the room was still somewhat dusty after the housekeepers did their jobs, but by that time, we were just ready to kick off our shoes and unwind. in retrospect, i guess we should have asked for a different room, but at the same time, i think the hotel should have simply offered us one.we ordered room service with our dining credit and were not overly pleased with it either. the chicken fingers were to die for, but the margherita pizza was not prepared well and the burger was overcooked and over-seasoned. the condiments as well as the accompaniments to the burger (the lettuce, onion, and tomato) arrived in uncovered dishes and ramekins. i can only imagine the dust particles that landed on these items as they traveled to our room. my husband and i are used to having someone from dining call us after we receive our food to see if everything was okay. needless to say, we did not receive any sort of call from in-room dining.despite the friendliness of the check-out clerk and the employees who helped us get in and out of the hotel, we will more than likely not return to this hotel. in our opinion, it‚äôs not worth the cost. you can get better service for equal to what we paid and even less in the atlanta area.stayed here 1 night (a thursday) for business, all common areas and rooms are decorated in very new-looking, modern style, with sleek furniture. somewhat unusual robes add to the decor. attention to detail everywhere..down to the tv and slow-closing toilet lid in bathroom. staff all had great demeanor and were very helpful...even asking how our dinner went upon our return from a recommendation of theirs. i happened to be awake when some clubs on the next block must have been shutting down and could hear some screaming party-goers for a few minutes in middle of night...would have been louder if lower than 25th floor. only other problem i had was with a non-functioning tv remote..that i was too tired to call about. not the best i've stayed in but very nice..conference facilities were similarly appointed and food service was good.i really liked this hotel and had been looking forward to staying here for some time. unfortunately, our first night was ruined by the loud music coming from a club opposite which went on until past 3 am. the staff are aware of this but we still got lumped in a room at the front. on top of this the shower was really pitiful and took and hour to drain.other than that it's a good place to stay. i can't say i was 100% comfortable with the neighbourhood but i'm from britain so can't really judge. ask for a room at the back if you're staying at the weekend. concierge was excellent and all the staff were really friendly. wish i could be more positive, but a good nights sleep is the minimum. i expect from $200 a night hoteli stayed at this hotel over the president's day weekend. upon check-in the front desk was not forth coming with the $75 per night hold that is placed on the cc for incidentals. i have never heard of a hotel that holds this much against your account. so for a 4 night stay make sure you have an extra $300 around for the privilege of staying here. on top of that for some reason the night audit decided my room did not have enough of a hold, so held another $250 against my cc.the internet was another $9.95 a night per device. so make sure that you do connect multiple devices or watch out when you check out!at check out, i had them process the final to my cc. they told me that the cc was declined. so i had to give them a separate cc to close out the charges to. when i called my cc company the only charges on the account were from the loews! so for some reason they could not even close out the account to the holds that they had on this cc.i decided to call the hotel for explanation of all of the cc holds and the front desk manager was apologetic. he did say he would credit me back for one of the nights of the stay.i honestly loved the hotel and would stay there again, but this whole nightmare will keep me from doing so.stayed at room 1909 for 4 days,housekeeping came to clean the room twice,instead of every 24 hours,when i reported the situation to the front desk they didn't care so i had an early checkout. will never stay in any loews hotelfirst of all, this is a beautiful hotel. new and contemporary, but not over the top. as others have stated, rooms are comfortable and bathroom fabulous. very friendly staff at desk and at the door. great location in the heart of midtown. lots of walkable restaurants and bars. the hotel bar is nice and has some really well crafted cocktails on the menu. unfortunately, the bar was taken over by a wedding party one night. looks like that might happen quite a bit as there is a sound system in the area of the bar, so don't plan on a quiet evening at the bar.now, the issue. we had a short stay on a friday and saturday night in july. i first noticed some loud thumping on friday night as i turned into bed shortly before 2 am. however, i had a few beverages before, so i just passed out in the bed in spite of it. on saturday, however, the bass thumping (presumably from a nightclub across the street) was reverberating so loud that i was not able to sleep until after 3 am. we were on about the 18th floor, so i can't imagine how loud the music was inside the club. to the hotel's credit, we called around 3 am to ask where the noise might be coming from and they apologized and offered to move us to another room. i wasn't much for moving all of my stuff at 3 am and figured the noise would stop soon enough.in short, great hotel, but until they find a way to stop this noise nuissance, you should make sure they can place you on the quiet side of the hotel or find another place to stay.i hope this review will save someone some sleep. most of all, i hope management will find a way to stop the noise so i can come stay here again. it really has a lot of potential.all the staff was inattentive. the doorman recommended we get a 40 dollar taxi ride to go eat at a restaurant that we discovered was half a block away. my company paid for the room but they still charged my credit card the full price of the room and it was a hassle to get it removed. a party was happening somewhere in the building and all the yelling was coming into my room through the air vents, and the street noise was not blocked at all by the thin windows. this hotel looks fancy and expensive but the materials are cheap, the staff is snooty, and the customer service is far below par.i was not going to write a review about my experience at the loews hotel atlanta because it was not a good one however, as i am sitting here this morning trying to book my birthday trip to santa monica at the end of this month i am frustrated. i had to planned to stay at the loews santa monica but since the management at loews atlanta has not returned my calls i do not want to stay in at another loews hotel. i now have to search for another hotel and i know nothing about other hotels in the area. frustrating.my fiance and i stayed at the loews atlanta back during october for a business event. upon returning to our room from the event we found that we that the a/c was blowing hot air. maintenance came, fixed the problem. we went down to the bar came back room and it was still hot. manintenance came back several times couldnt fix the a/c and the hotel was 100% booked so moving into another room was not an option. things happen and i understand that no one could control the a/c going out. we could have at least been offered a fan, i had to request that one be sent to our room!!! (pic of fan attached, it was loud lol)upon check out the next morning we told the front desk about our problem and asked to speak to the manager. assistant manager (stephanie) was busy and asked front desk to take all of my information and said alex would give me a call or email. i have left several messages for stephanie and alex, still no return phone call!!!!! my fiance and i went to the hotel after eating in midtown on 1/28/2011, spoke with assistant manager stepahie who said she would pass my information along to alex and he would call me. still no return phone call as of 2/12/2011.this is not the level of service that i would expect from the a loews hotel.ok first issue has to be with the lack of a pool, come on now, i asked the front desk why they didnt have a pool and they responded with the statement that most atlanta hotels dont have pools yet while i walked around the city, the w had a pool, the hilton has a pool, the embassy suites has a pool, etc etc., so why would a 4star place not have one especially since they have the space to put it on top of the parking deck?>parking, they try to charge you $30 to park, park across the street at the lot for five dollars a night but watchout because they will put a boot on your car if you dont pay, everyday 3 or 4 people got boots put on.the hotels was having water pressure issues my entire stay, when showering the water would not come out and the sink would not have water coming out of the faucet.no gym> again this is a 4star hotel why is there no gym?in all honesty if i wouldnt of gotten a pretty good deal for the opening weekend i would have been very upset, trust me not the best luxury place to stay i'd give this hotel above average status but not great.my experience started with making a reservation on the spg site. while making the reservation i checked the box provided for early check-in. what i found out was at this hotel does not permit early check-in, even when the room is available. in fact, an early check-in will result in a charge of 1/2 day. i have never had an experience where my room is actually available and i was not permitted to check in early. a first. why would the website offer such a preference if it would not honor it. secondly, this is an old hotel. i heard staff talk about the renovation to come, but in its current state it is an outdated frumpy hotel. the bathrooms in the rooms on the executive club level are tiny and they don't have a walk in shower. but for the great towels and bath accessories you would think you were in a 2 star hotel. there is also no television in the club lounge which i thought was strange. i hear it's coming with the renovation...where to begin with the whitley?the good:-very convenient for the peachtree road race- hotel lobby is beautiful- pool is nice- room service breakfast was good (but pricey)- they still serve the cold-pressed juices previously served by the ritzthe bad:-check-in took nearly 30 minutes-room smelled of smoke, found ashes on the floor, food and a nail grooming toolroom was extremely dirty, especially the carpet (we were moved to a clean room, but still seemed outdated)-valet parking is $40+-poor customer service (issues weren‚äôt handled promptly)-there is one elevator that will not allow access to certain floors even with the card (heard many people complain about this)we have stayed here several years when it was the ritz, and the customer service was always incredible. it‚äôs lacking anything special now, and the rooms are really dated. seems that prices have increased on food as well. not sure we‚äôll return again, which is disappointing considering how convenient this is to run the peachtree.i travel to atlanta and stay in buckhead several time a year. i have stayed at several local hotels, my favorite being the intercontinental. as of this review, i will have stayed at the whitley twice...my first and my last.rooms - they were fine. nothing exciting but to be honest not as run down\" as a lot of these reviews seem to state. not the nicest but def not bad enough to make me rethink sleeping there.housekeeping - again, pretty ok. did a good job and in a timely fashion.food - we really didn't eat here. prices are astronomical. i will pay money for good food but $27 for eggs and bacon is just stupid. i can get a filet and two sides at dantannas across the street for dinner for $29.service - this was where i had problems. the staff at this hotel are in some serious need of training. tons of problems checking in, i ended up having to give them a cash deposit in order to get into my room that i had already paid for (never has happened to me ever). woman checking me in all but threw my room keys at us and never even told us where the elevators were. very condascending. i am an spg member, but never got our free wi-fi code. was told the next day we could get a limo pick up from a concert, some weirdo keeps calling me trying to find us...not a limo, just a car. the price went from $45 as told by the hotel staff to $80 by the \"limo\" driver. luckily i had enough cash. he actually got mean with me when i said i only had $65. went to check out the last day and retrieve my cash deposit. i was told they needed to go check mini bar first. 20 minutes pass and i am still waiting to check out, mind you i wanted to get on the road. i finally demanded my money back (never touched the mini bar anyways). i was finally given my money and oh wow they comped our parking due to the horrific way we were treated.\"the rooms haven't been renovated in forever! what a dump. pick something more modern or at least better taken care of. terrible front desk service. super long wait to check in. inappropriate dinner recommendation from concierge. awful place. don't fool yourself into thinking it might be nice because it used to be the ritz. there are too many other options in buckhead.i booked this hotel for a weekend getaway from pennsylvania thi king the 5 star experience would make the weekend just a little extra nice. it was awful, but it wasn't great.i'll start with the location was nice. they gym was amazing.when i arrived i was asked to participate in their green\" program. meaning someone would clean our room ever third day. i felt a little.obkigayed to say yes, but that's on me. on the day they arrived to clean i was still in room... they never came back. i assumed they would clean the next day, they didn't. when i called to complain i was told it was because i was enrolled in their green program and they only come every three days. i expresses that i understood but they didn't come on the third day. at 8:30pm they sent someone to service my room. and the lovely robes, she took them and never replaced them, disappointing.i had breakfast at their trade roots restaurant earlier that day. their menu was interesting. i ordered the tater tot pancakes with an egg over easy instead of sunny side up and my boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict. mine was not at all what i had envisioned, came out with an egg over hard, and instead of the smoked gouda it advertised - came out with swiss (yuck). his eggs benedict cane out cooked solid. the waiter never came back so sending anything back wasn't even made an option.i paid $54 for some terribly dry breakfast that didn't even come close to tasting good.my next trip to atlanta will be spent somewhere else.\"this was just okay for me. it‚äôs definitely not a 5 star hotel as advertised and needs a complete makeover. the bar was cool and the lobby area was very nice, however everything else was a bit disappointing. the bathrooms weren‚äôt properly cleaned, we found strands of hair in the sink and counter tops. there was also a very odd smell in the room. i really regret deciding to stay here on this particular night because this was the night i decided to propose to my girlfriend. i‚äôm not trying to bash this hotel by any means because the staff were very friendly. the proposal went very well and was completely satisfying until we made it to our hotel room. i don't think i would stay here again unless i was offered a better room.we checked in last night to the whitley (formerly the ritz carlton) in buckhead. the website boasts that this is newly renovated. the lobby and dinning area has been renovated but the rooms are the same ol ritz carlton rooms. and when i say same ol, i mean same old ritz rooms that needed to have been update a couple years ago. while the staff and the room was nice and clean, the bed, carpet and chair definitely showed signs of needing to be updated.we were woken up from a dead sleep at 3:30am by guests two doors down screaming and yelling and fighting. we called the front desk and was told that security was on the way and that we were about the fourth caller. after about 15 min my husband called again and was told that this was the second time security was called on their room. this continued on for about 15 min when i went to the front desk. security finally brought the guests down and escorted one of the guests out.i will say that in the end the front desk did give us points toward a future stay which was nice. i do wish i would have gotten a good nights sleep, however.i was eager to check out the whitley, since i was a fan of the previous rtiz. however, it seems the whitley has not yet remodeled anything but the bar & restaurant.service at check-in was fine. i noticed others at the front desk had champagne, and there were glasses and an ice bucket with champagne, but we we're not offered any. i should have asked, but we were in a bit of a rush.the rooms need updating, badly. the decor is the same as the ritz from the 90's. popcorn ceilings, faded furniture. the doors need attention -- we could hear every single noise in the hallway. that was a bit frustrating.the lobby features a coffee bar, which is a great idea! however, the service was terrible. i asked for an iced latte and it was immediately clear the girl working had no idea how to do that. she attempted to make it, but it was terrible. while this bar is a great addition, i'd suggest making sure the staff is properly trained to make the drinks offered.the hotel mentioned they plan to remodel this year, so i'm hopeful, but would not stay there again until they do.this property may have once been a ritz carlton, but it is no longer at that level. the lobby is nice and it tails off from there. the front desk experience is sterile at best. the rooms are small. they are nicely appointed. but the door to my room had a large gap at the bottom and on the side. as a result, all of the noise from the hallway intrudes into the room. and the doors are set up such that they cannot be closed quietly- i tried.while voices from the adjacent rooms were not audible, everything else was. and then there was noise from above - i think from construction. i called to complain about this last one. the response from the front desk was that they would check into it. but it continued.for the price i expect much better.i have called this hotel 3 days in a row to cancel a reservation spending some 3 hours on the phone and i still don't have a cancellation confirmation. i'm sick and tired of being put on hold. you may want to stay here if you're sure you are not ever going to cancel but otherwise you are better off staying somewhere else.this hotel was the ritz carlton til dec 1, when it switched to starwoods luxury collection. the transition is not smooth with many delays in checking in, including inability to check in for hours, delays in making key cards, and having no records of previous patronage at what formerly a luxury hotel. the desk staff were all new and had only worked there a few days. their inexperience showed, though they were extremely interactive. wifi was terrible and repeatedly went down. the executive lounge maintained the previous staff , and was the saving grace of the stay with wonderful service and food.this hotel is a huge disappointment. they just changed from a ritz carlton a few weeks ago. if you are looking for ritz carlton service, this is definately not the hotel for you. i purchased a certificate for a 3 night stay at a silent auction at the end of 2016, it was valid through 12/30/17. as my travel schedule played out for 2017, i realized i wasn't going to make it to atlanta in 2017, which is totally on me. however, i have had firm dates for march 2018. when my dates became firm (october 17), i called to reserve. it was still a ritz carlton at that point. they told me to call in december, as the certificate says to book within 90 days, which is 100% fine, and they were also being rebranded into the whitley. so i called on 12/19, the 90 day window to the executive office, which is the instructions on the certificate. no call back. i called again 12/20, again no call back. i called this morning to the main number, the woman who answered the phone was very helpful and nice. she said she would need to check with the executive office. so she put me on hold and came back and said the executive office said no. the executive office\" couldn't even see fit to tell me themselves. isn't that executives are supposed to do? my husband and i were very nice on the phone. but the management at this hotel is awful!!!! i am calling the st regis buckhead now to reserve the same dates.\"magical christmas feeling of the ritz buckhead is gone! the staff & food where excellent (a lot of same people have stayed on during the transition of the whitley). although the buffet was limited & not like the ritz usually featured. there was no prime rib or turkey!!it is very sad the once beautiful lobby bar, lounge & cozy fireplace as you walk in hotel are replaced with cold, unappealing colors and strange artwork. as a patron for 25 years and have so many lovely memories of the warm & bustling place is now just like any other average hotel. there is nothing special about the hotel now! the ritz just had a specialfeeling about it~a neighborhood hangout, that was very welcoming with so many great amenities! the huge fireplace & the ritz will be missed ( along with the staff).been to christmas brunch for the last 10 years at ritz and can‚äôt believe the difference in one year! there where hardly anyone there compared to last year~barely any christmas decorations. it is going to be hard to find another place like the ritz buckhead!! sad!the old charm of the ritz at christmas is gone. the laughter having tea children seeing santa has been reduced to what appears to be a bad remodel of an attempt to make a modern bar. the bar was so out of place it was uncomfortable. gone is the ritz service -not once when we visited the past five years did we open a door-bellman always opened doors. this time not once did someone open the door for us. even when we were checking in and leaving with luggage. it felt like a ghost town. the service was gone -we booked an executive suite through marriott which included breakfast. when we checked in we were given a nice king room\" no. breakfast. it was pointless to even try and explain what we booked. --it's a shame. we won't stay here again. sad end to a great property in a great location.\"pros: great location; comfortable roomcons:1)upon very late (11:30pm) check-in on 12/15/17, i was asked three times if we needed our bags taken to our room. after having said yes\" two times, i assumed they wanted us to take our own bags, which we did.2) an authorization for $478 was made to my credit card upon check-in (more than enough for a 2-night stay). the next morning, another authorization was made for $100. upon check-out on 12/17/17, i inquired about the $100 authorization, but it was not showing on my card anymore. the lady who checked us out assured me that authorizations would be replaced with the actual amount of the bill. however, another authorization for $219 was made to my credit card for a total of $697 in authorizations. to make matters worse, we were charged for internet service even though my reservation (that was made while it was a ritz-carlton) had my spg number on it. the internet charges were removed after she added my spg rewards number.3) i received no email or other correspondence about the hotel changing names. when you arrive at a hotel from out-of-town and it has a different name and signage, it is disconcerting. i had to ask the valet if we were at the correct hotel. this should never happen.after researching the name change (the only ritz-carlton in the us to change names), it appears marriott didn't want to spend the money necessary to renovate the hotel so they turned over the management of it to hei hotels & resorts. it's still in the marriott portfolio, just being managed by a different company.the hotel was not busy as in past years. employees were overheard talking about how so many other employees had quit because of the changeover. customers pay to stay at the ritz-carlton, not the whitley.we will be staying at the westin or embassy suites in the future.\"it was devastating to enter what used to be a luxurious, beautiful environment complete with live music only to find they have completely stripped the beautiful finishes and added cheap finishes and bright mod\" lighting. the space now feels like an upscale denny's or nordstrom cafe. certainly the ritz could have used a little updating, but this is heartbreaking. we used to love going for cocktails, listen to the music and do a little dancing. that's no longer an option and we have no reason to ever visit again. beautiful marble fireplace - gone. wood paneling - gone. ambiance and \"mood\" - gone. can't comment on the food because we couldn't wait to leave we were so sad. traditional ritz christmas teas and holiday get togethers are a thing of the past.\"first, let me say we have been going to this ritz 3-4 times a year for 15 years and are gold level memebers. this was our home away from home when we came to atlanta, for holidays, cheer competitions, pretty much every time we came to atlanta. however, this experience was horrible. the ritz is changing at the end of the month to another high end hotel\". we were going to give the new hotel a chance, but if this weekend was any indication, this was our last stay here. first, they messed up our reservation. we were celebrating our 15th anniversary and had reserved thursday to sunday in a suite on the club level. we got a suite on the 14th floor with no club access. when we called to tell them it was a mistake, the manager on duty, i believe his name was christain, told us the club was a max capacity and they could not get us access. we did not even ask to be moved, just have access to the club. he then grudgingly offered us breakfast for free. when my wife asked for something else, like champagne or cocktails in the evening, the manager condescendingly told her \"i think i have been more than accomadating to you\". he did end up sending a bottle to our room but it felt more like a chore than an apology from the ritz for messing up our reservation. we also carry the ritz carlton cc and called their concierge who looked it up and saw our original reservation with the club level access. they called the hotel to talk to the front desk. the front desk then called my wife and told her it was her fault the reservation was wrong and she must have cancelled it and rebooked it wrong. we have been staying here for 15 years with club access every time, why would we change it on our anniversary. we were so outdone, we checked out after 1 night and went to another hotel. do not stay here. one of the bellman that we know very well said they have lost 90% of their original staff and the current staff is from other ritz carltons. if this is true, they need to be retrained because this is not how ritz employees treat guests. they still carry the ritz name until the end of the month and should still be held to the ritz standard\"this ritz carlton is definitely not up to ritz standards. restaurant is more in line with a holiday inn. food is below average. hotel is changing name in 2018, watch for that!! front desk staff not well trained, no personalization, no welcome.this is not a ritz i will ever stay at again. over many years we have stayed here with good results. last month we reserved two connected rooms on the club floor. we checked in and were told that so sorry that because of the hurricane we could not accommodate you on the club floor but several floors below. oh and by the way the connecting room is not ready due to a late checkout for a platinum member. three hours later, well after the agreed to checkout time they left. so so sorry was all that was offered. the ritz has also become a kennel for dog lovers who enjoy sharing their precious ones with all in the hotel. after 2 nights of chaos and nothing offered to compensate for the horrific service we left. btw the club floor was a waste of moneystupid me, i decided to give it another try this weekend. i requested a room away from the noise and wedding parties. of course i was assured that we would have a deluxe king room on a quiet floor...not the case. we were put next to a suite for the wedding party. incredible noise. called to ask for a move because of course at this hotel the offended party must move. so sorry sir we are sold out!! after unloading i was assured they would find us a quiet room...next to the elevator. so nice of them. finally after again expressing my frustration a quiet room was finally found for us. so sorry sir that this happened to you!! for your troubles we will not charge you for this evening. so nice of them!!! we left early this morning avoiding the crappy buffet that was part of the weekend ‚äúdeal‚äù. forgot to mention that i am platinum premier with over 2500 nights at marriott properties all over the world. this hotel is a joke. overrated, worn down with awful management. the jw marriott across the street is superior as is the w, mandarin and hyatt all close by.where do i start. a little about myself. i'm a younger guy (35 years old) and i've stayed at my fair amount of luxury hotels\" from numerous ritz carlton hotels to four seasons to waldorf astoria. ritz carltons are similar to waldorf astorias. you know the staff will be great, great property, etc.this hotel has the most rude staff i've ever encountered at a hotel before (luxury or not luxury). before i get into my detailed review (note i'm still here at the hotel) let me state that i paid/used the perks of the platinum american express where you get free breakfast, free wifi, last and early check-in.checking in: started off nice and went down hill fast. the lady who checked us in was extremely not helpful. didn't explain for the fitness center, pool and where breakfast was ate. said we had free wifi which i'll get into later. there are things they're suppose to give you (survey) when you check in as part of the fine hotels program with american express and they didn't do that, probabaly because they know what their product was like.room: get to my room and guess what.....wasn't the one in the pictures or the floor plan highlighted. booked an executive suite with the living room, a huge master bathroom and a half bath because i usually get up in the morning before the person with me and i wouldn't wake him up. the room we got only had one (extremely small) bathroom that you almost had to step on the toilet to get into the shower.i call the front desk but goes to an operator who puts me on hold for five minutes. comes back and says the front desk is busy and they will call me back. twenty minutes later no call. so i go downstairs since i had some place to be in an hour and we needed to get ready. go downstairs and talk to a larger gentlemen (around 40s) and i say to him that i called down and was waiting for a call back. he was like \"well why did you call\" with an attitude. it's like don't get mad at me. by the way no one was at the front desk. he made a big deal about getting me the room that was booked. it's no my problem that the have different room types. they should be asking people what room type they want or not advertise a totally different room online on their corporate website.long story short i get the room that was booked. by the way asked for my id, i didn't have it, but he gave me the room keys anyway (can we say security concern). major red flag.a positive is the living room air is awesome! bedroom not so much and was hot at night.breakfast - food was good. only downfall was we ordered a second round of drinks at breakfast and had to wait about ten minutes.at the pool (again had to call to find out where it was because they never told us where it was at) barely any seating outside. i wanted to get out of the sun and move the chair to the shade and was barked at thirty minutes after being there and told i can't do that cause it's a fire hazard. friend with me that was inside overheard the same guy yelling and being rude to other guests as well.still here but if you expect the same type of service as a typical ritz carlton, don't expect it.i'm sure some manager will write some bs response to this review saying they were sorry, blah blah blah. clearly there are many issues with staffing as hearing from other people at the hotel. i already complained once (front desk when having to go back down) but he didn't want to hear it.calling corporate on monday and they can be the mediator between the hotel and myself. also calling american express as this hotel should not be part of the fine hotels program cause it's anything but fine.again, i've been to numerous ritz before (ft lauderdale, st thomas, chicago, biscane key, phoenix, and other locations). definitely leaves a horrible taste in my mouth.\"completely agree .. we checked in yesterday after a very recent stay at rc in cancun which is also a fabulous hotel.all other rc's i have stayed in have a signature restaurant, the grill in cancun as a recent example.here, the restaurant is more like a breakfast cafe. ok if you want a sandwich or burger and chips but don't expect anything more as you will be disappointed.we had a great welcome yesterday and staying for a few days. the executive lounge is fab, the room is loverly the staff are the usual high rc standard. birthday special last night so we booked the restaurant some time ago but very disappointed with the layout, ambiance and menu offers. the hotel seems full, the bar was full and the restaurant was empty on a friday night. says it all .. i am afraid you have got this so wrong rc.all ritzcarlton properties are first class, this was no exception. i stayed there for a conference and the staff treated us with first class service from the wake up call to settling your bill there are no better trained people......front desk staff member was not welcoming and unfamiliar with rewards programs. this was my first visit at this location. the front desk staff member swiped my credit card for incidentals, handed me the room key, and said thank you. she did not explain the hotel amenities and services, rewards member benefits, not even the location of the elevators. i enjoy staying at the ritz-carlton but i'll never return to this location.when i arrived i ask the man, in the driveway, if i could leave my car here for a few minutes while i checked in & changed clothes-he firmly replied that i could only leave it there 15 min. i was the only car on the driveway! as you know it's the little things that irritate you5+ star hotelstayed at the rc buckhead on a recent business trip. stayed at this hotel quite a bit in the mid 90's and nothing has changed since. the rooms are the same as they were back than with this old heavy outdated furnishing. not the ritz of today's standards. i will say that the staff was excellent and very friendly. do yourself a favor and stay at the mandarin till this hotel gets a facelift.fantastic location. trash in trash can. foreign residue on kleenex box in bathroom. scattered debris on carpet. unfriendly at checkin and surprise charges. poorly stocked gift shop. best part about the hotel is the valet. rooms leave much to be desired. no additional toiletries or towels provided as requested. pool is atrocious. hardly can enjoy through the thick stench of the chlorine. the pool service is nothing more than you offered a towel when you walk in (on occasion) beware the floors are very slick and not dried by the pool attendant at all. we requested something special in the room to mark a special occasion and for the additional shock factor i'll let you know nothing was done!! we unfortunately cancelled at the four seasons and left the ritz carlton very disappointed. will not make the mistake again.ritz carlton buckhead front desk showed their true colors during a business trip where i showed up to check in wearing urban street wear. i was treated like a second class citizen and ended up checking out a few days early. i had a history of staying at this hotel on all business trips to atlanta for about 15 years. needless to say that this has opened my mind to visiting other hotel chains in the area when i visit atl.maybe i'm just not a ritz-carlton kinda gal. the hotel is lovely with exquisite details and an attentive staff but when we pay this amount for a hotel, i would have expected that things like internet and coffee would be included. or an affordable onsite breakfast. we walked up the street to the corner bakery daily for breakfast and coffee.we were on the club lounge floor. the lounge was outstanding.the staff was very good and the food and drink way above averagethe pool area was below average for a ritz hotel. the exercise area was adequate, but nothing special. the hotel seemed to cater to the business community and the surrounding area very busy with large shopping centers withinb walking distance.a step back in time with all the modern amenities and touches. great staff, food and location. even though undergoing a major outdoor construction project, from within there were no disruptions or unwanted noise.wonderful expreience with staff and restaurant. terribly disappointed in the new decor of the hotel. it has lost all of the elegance and romance it had and has fallen into a trendy decor that looks very cheap\" for what you pay for a night there. probably will seek out a new place to stay.\"as noted by other travelers, the hotel itself is in an excellent location; the rooms are lovely although ours appeared to be a little worn in some ways, but was still spotlessly clean. the staff - as with all ritz-carlton hotels - are excellently trained and most accommodating. the lounge is a lovely respite at the end of a long day.i would have given the hotel a much higher rating, except: my complaint is based solely on the fact that the day after i checked out, flew home, and was attempting to catch up\" at the office, i received a telephone call on my personal cell phone during business hours which was a sales solicitation for marriott timeshare. it was extremely annoying and i deeply resent the fact that my personal telephone number was used in such a manner.\"we always have a problem of some sort at this hotel. while the staff is exceptional, problems always arise. on the other hand, the ritz carlton atlanta (downtown on peachtree street) is superb. stay there. the value for the experience is not worthy of staying at buckhead. it is worthy of staying on peachtree street.the food was great!! the shrimp tortellini was amazing!the service lacked a lot. before dinner we went to the lounge we had to flag down three waitresses to get service. once seated at the caf√© we had completed our starter course before the drinks that we ordered as soon as we sat down were delivered to the table. while the quality of the food was what i expect from a ritz the service was incredibly dissatisfying.too crowded for good service. lobby bar $25 cover for live band. after entering almost nowhere to sit. very crowded food orders take one hour. wait staff overwhelmed. not impressed. had to leave to get dinner and drinks. so much for calibrating new years eve.i am a frequent traveler. i typically stay in 4-5 star hotels. i arranged a special night for my wife and myself. i called ritz reservations and explained my needs. i was looking for an upgradable rate and i am platinum with the ritz. i was informed i needed to purchase a higher rate to upgrade. they recommended i pay with amex to get more benefits. when i arrived i was informed that they never upgrade and all rooms were booked yet i could go on ritz site on internet and book better room. i was told i had a $100 credit so decided to eat at the cafe. the cafe's portions were a joke unless u were on a 200 calorie diet and the food quality was not as good as waffle house. and at check out i only received a $50 credit. avoid this hotel at all costs. if you want great service and five star treatment go to st regis or the mandarin oriental hotels.i've stayed at the ritz beverly hills before, and i found this hotel to be far inferior. i don't mind paying a higher rate for high quality service and food, but this place definitely fell short. $80 for room service of eggs benedict that tastes like it came from a crappy diner down the street? no thanks! went to use the steam room and found it inaccessible and not working. gym leaves much to be desired well. the beds are hard and uncomfortable, and nothing worked in my room. don't waste your money on this place.i stayed here often when in buckhead section of atlanta. the hotel is fabulous in every way, except the location. i am the type that likes to walk to restaurants and bars, and not have to get in a car or a taxi. this ritz carlton requires a car. there is a very nice shopping center across the street, but the walk is not great. the street you have to cross is very busy and it feels like i am in danger of being run over. when you do get across, there are a limited choices of restaurants there. you really do need a car to get to downtown buckhead. a bit inconvenient for me.i'm a platinum member of marriott but i didn't receive any type of personalization or feel welcomed by the ritz. i could get over that if the hotel had been in better shape. it is old and outdated. the windows were filthy so the view of atlanta is obstructed.this hotel has a tremendous amount of potential, but falls short of its potential. the service and food are exceptional but at a very high cost. the in room dining is off the charts expensive, although good quality. the biggest disappointment was the condition of the rooms and furnishings. the mandarin oriental definitely is a nicer quality hotel and is the same cost.there are many great hotels in buckhead...this is not one of them! go somewhere else and save money while having a better experience. it's a win-win! there is a jw right around the corner. cheaper and nicer!service typical of ritz hotel which was excellent. building exterior and rooms are something out of the seventies and terrible. hotel needs major upgrade otherwise service and staff was what is expected of a ritz, simply great. the food was excellent too.when you stay at a ritz-carlton property, you expect to experience the apex of customer service. that's because for decades, this brand has earned a reputation for having the best trained staff that looks for ways to create a blow away experience. unfortunately, when great brands get gobbled up by big corporations, they many times lack the passion the founders had, and execution suffers. this is clearly what happened here.from the time we checked into our non smoking room that smelled like someone smoked a box of cohiba robustos (they quickly moved us)...to trying to order lunch from the menu they gave us, only to find out that menu wasn't valid, and we would have to order from a new menu...to a pre-arranged meeting with the concierge who was missing in action for 20 minutes at the 6pm dinner hour. so to add insult to injury, they empower their employee's to give a glass of cheap champagne to the grieving guest to ease the pain. i had so much champagne that day, i had a headache!the best part about this is later that week, i was a guest at the four seasons in nyc and experienced the outstanding service that made the ritz famous...great sanity check as great service still lives!lastly, there are some great people working at this great property (spa was outstanding) , but the training and execution is just lacking. why don't they just rename the place the buckhead marriott so the level of expectation matches the experience???ritz carlton has a reputation for service and quality...but not at this one. i've stayed at ritz carlton for years, but the check-in at this one was different. i brought my daughters in from all over the country for a girls weekend, and made reservations over 6 weeks ago: 2 rooms, adjoining. check-in was at 3:00, and i called at 9:00 am to make sure all was set, and was assured it was. we checked in at 3:30, rooms were not ready. to make a long story short, we did not get into our rooms until 6:00 pm. the first check-in clerk said the adjoining rooms were not available\". his manager said \"not available\". amazingly, a new check-in clerk who was there at 5:45 found our rooms and we checked in. he was great, sorry i did not have him to start with. we were there for less than 24 hours, and spent nearly 3 of those hours waiting on a room. i do not recommend this hotel, i have stayed at the international and the w, much better experience.\"i travel frequently and i must say i was highly unimpressed with this ritz carlton. the room was smaller than any average hotel room. i was very surprised to tell you the truth. the bathroom was nice but again very small. the beds were very comfortable. the decor in the rooms and floor hallways were very dated. the lobby is nice but no reflection of the rest of the hotel. i also don't like paying extra for parking ($17 self park with no exit/entry privileges or $35 valet) oh boy what a great choice after paying $400/night for a room? i just don't get it and i would recommend staying somewhere else as there are many choices in the area. as a side note the traffic outside this hotel during afternoon rush hour is pretty much stand still. not even exaggerating. it takes 20 minutes to move less than a half mile during rush hour. not even worth trying to drive during this time.the club floor service could not better at any hotel. the staff are incredible they remember your name from a stay 4 months ago, your preferred drink!!! you can just eat in the lounge, however it has a world class restaurant, as well!was making revations for the weekend for my wifes birthday and was asking for something special to be in the room when we arrived and the desk person acted like it was going to be a major inconvenience for them and pretty much told me that was not her job and i explained that the intercontinental was going to make it special for my wife and she said that she wished me a nice stay there.. and i must say it was the best stay any where. to whom ever you are thank you..on a football weekend, espn channels malfunctioned in room 2030. ulysses from engineering rresponded immediately. he diagnosed a failing mother board. he replaced the tv and quickly set up a new one. problem solved quickly and efficiently as one expects from ritz personnel.hotel is pleasant as you would expect from a ritz.however, the parking deck exits to a sharp right turn to the lobby entrance.the curb at this location is scarred in tire and wheel marks including from the valet who was driving my truck.usa parking (ryan ross) denied the small claim, which if you were to google seems to be a pattern for this company. the ritz (daniel) went into silent mode.beware of valet and usa parkingstaying for peachtree run-- right at start-- great locale-- good staff-- well attentive--across from lenox shopping and across to the east from phipps plaza-- easy to get to from about every angle-- -good location for fireworks that nite though i didn't stay for that-- but have in past-- for the money for the race rate-- excellent choiceimagine a long day of business travel. you choose dinner over early check in, and then arrive at the property at 11pm. i knew the hotel was sold out because i'd tried to get a coworker a room that day and been told, nope, not possible\". clark and tyrone search every room and say, \"hey, bad news, we have to upgrade you, the hotel is full full full!\"awesome.\"we stayed at the ritz in buckhead for one night. the woodwork in the lobby was beautiful, the staff members were a delight. the decor in the rooms and rest of hotel is a bit dated. the afternoon tea was great. our room was small but by no means cramped. our bed was comfy, plush and clean. the bathroom was quite small, but nonetheless beautiful. the rain shower head was the highlight of the bathroom (after experiencing this, i went straight to hd and bought one for my home shower). the robes that were provided in the room were nice, however, i feel they have seen their prime and should be replaced. i was saddened when i went to use the indoor pool, they had an early closing time of 10pm, which was when we returned from dinner. so, i was only able to dip my feet into the jacuzzi for about 10 minutes.at once point during our stay, we were followed to our floor by a man who was obviously not a guest of the hotel. he approached us asking for money. we reported this, by phone to the concierge, and we never heard back about the situation, from there on out, we were on edge and did not feel safe at this hotel. a key card is not needed to enter the side entrances, so anyone can walk in, leaving the guests venerable to criminal activity. the ritz need to get with the times and up security.the hotel is in a great location and the price is not out of line for a 5 star hotel, the front desk and door staff are wonderful, but that is where the 5 star part ends. the rooms are nothing special, they are really old fashioned looking. they look like any hotel room anywhere. the food in the cafe was ok, and the service was fair. when a specific item was requested, they tried to serve a lesser quality product as the one requested. when called on it, they suddenly had the one we asked for. other items requested during the meal, never appeared. the price of food in the restaurant and the bar is crazy expensive. next visit to atlanta we will try another hotel.i have stayed at both ritz carlton's in atlanta, the biggest difference between the two is that the rc buckhead is in a much nicer area. my wife use to choose the downtown location for when she joined me on biz trips, but since the macy's (rich's) downtown closed a decade ago, she now prefers the location in buckhead. first this is a ritz in the truest sense of the word and although ritz is usually awesome, the ritz's in atlanta are better than even the ritz in new york (as far as service) it is just silly how good the service is here. the location, across the street from the lenox square mall, is a real plus, with great restaurants and shopping and especially at christmas with it all lit up and festive with this thing called the pink pig. also, now that they have finished construction on the new city center area of buckhead, there is even more restaurants on the same side of the street within a short walk. the rooms are plush and really well appointed and the common areas and bar are ritz and the service again is just too good to believe. the views from the room are stunning, atlanta and even buckhead have really pretty skylines, especially at night. as far as parking you have the option of either valet or pretty reasonable offsite parking immediately adjacent to the hotel. for those who don't know buckhead and nearby midtown are the trendy, party, restaurant sections of north atlanta and shopping and entertainment are everywhere. i usually drive, but the marta is nearby and goes straight from the airport to buckhead, and the station is only a short distance from the ritz via provided shuttle or a fun walk. the biggest plus to this hotel is the weekend rates in atlanta, you can easily find rates for less than $200.00 a night and on occasion for even less, which makes it not only one of the best ritz carlton's i have stayed at, but also hands down the best value in atlanta. so, if you are looking for that extra something whether on a biz trip or that weekend gettaway to atlanta, the ritz buckhead just might be the exclamation point on a great visit to hotlanta! again it is silly how awesome this hotel is.nice hotel and the guest rooms are nice and clean but i felt like the party apparently going on in the room next to me was taking place in my room. granted they were obnoxiously loud but even doors opening and closing was super loud. no hotels are necessarily quiet\" but this was exceptional. i was here for one night for business and won't be back.\"i love the ritz carlton chain, however this location has not been updated in years! it is long overdue! i wouldn't recommend this hotel in its current state. i would however stay if it is updated as the location is amazing!room service is cheap. microwave popcorn? so i ordered cheese plate. also cheap. cold. like you'd find on a domestic airplane for $4. also, i was on hold for room service. you can't hire a few more people to answer the phone? then the tablecloth in banquet room was so worn out it was shedding on my suit. cheap. food was also exceptionally ordinary. so then, i figured i'd go to the gift shop to get the lint off my suit. i needed a razor too. nope. gift shop closed. at 7:30pm. you can't hire a few more people to run it for $12 an hour?in short, you are trying to run with margins that are too high. you are going to mass affluent\" instead of high end, and it shows.oh, one more thing: the \"honor bar\" has an electronic reading for what is removed (as all minibars do, which is fine). you need to at least use words correctly. that is not an \"honor bar\".everyone was friendly. the staff is not the problem. the margins are. you need to hire more people, pay them more, and have higher quality food.\"first time staying here in a while. the rc experience is not what it was. outside grounds could use upgrade. staff are good but something is missing. room is nice but a little disappointed in amex upgrade but didn't make a fuss since solo. i'll mostly try the mo next time i'm in atlanta.i am a frequent traveler for business and pleasure and spent a lot of time in hotels around the world. i recently had a stop in atlanta after returning from france and reserved with the the ritz-carlton in buckhead. i've been to atlanta in the past and have stayed at many of the other luxury competitors in the area but decided to give the ritz-carlton buckhead a try.walking into the lobby i was greeted by no one and walked to the check-in desk to get the pleasure\" of talking with clark. clark begin the check in process and took my identification and credit card for security. i thought the process was simple enough and my girlfriend and i walked up to the room to rest after our long flights.i can not recall the exact number but i was given a key for room 1505 or 1504. either way upon reaching the room and opening the door we noticed there was clothing and medication in the bathroom. we were completely shocked to find that we have been given the key to another guest room!we exited immediately and went back to the front desk to be greeted by a smug and disrespectful hotel attendant who thought he was not at fault. apparently clark and the ritz-carlton buckhead believe its okay to give keys to other guest rooms without considering the possible risk or safety for me or the person that could have been in the room. that is completely unprofessional and unacceptable!clark informed me that he had me reserved in a room with a stranger and that was the only reservation on the books. i produced my email confirmation and clark decided his job was done and told me if i did not want to stay in the room previously provided, there was nothing he could do.at 10pm after a 12+ hour flight and jet lag i was sick of dealing with clark and the poor excuse for management at the ritz-carlton buckhead and proceeded to another luxury hotel in the area. not only did clark and the ritz-carlton buckhead management fail at providing any solution to the problem they created they also failed at guest security and basic customer service. i have never received treatment from any ritz-carlton or other hotels the way i did that night. i will be sure to warn colleagues and family to keep their business away from this motel.\"i stay in about 30-40 hotels a year. i don't stay in only particular chains, as i think each city has it's gems. recently, (within the past 2 months) i've stayed at ritz-carlton san francisco, ritz-carlton chicago and ritz-carlton georgetown/dc. they all were heads above ritz buckhead. don't stay here unless you are a bride-to-be and are planning your wedding here. all brides and wedding parties appear to take priority over all other guests. it is crowded here on weekends with wedding parties dominating all services - cafe, bar, front desk, car service. it's crazy. my husband and i used to stay here 4-5x/yr and always upgraded to club level (floors 17-19). the evening appetizers used to be over-the-top, truly. we would look fwd to our evening cocktail hour. now they are cheap. lots of cheese and crackers, pigs in blanket, pasta with tomatoes. cheap to make. and let me clarify- food on club level is not gratis- we pay $200 more per night. we were so disppointed after our first evening of hors de horves, that when slamming doors and loud conversations in the hallway caused us to call security and lose sleep, we said 'never again'. such a huge disappointment, as we always looked forward to our stays here years ago. but there are so many other better choices of hotels in buckhead.what a joke of a hotel. bill marriott would be ashamed of the pathetic response and service my wife and i experienced yesterday as we attempted to check into the hotel. between the lines, little kids with their pet parents whining and dogs in the lobby and hallways it was a horrible experience. i asked for a quiet room at the end of the hallway and was assured that was the case. oh so wrong. not even close. the second attempt for a quiet room....one floor below was with thesame location and issues. the front desk manager fed me a line of bs when we left that this was a premium room blah blah blah. sorry sorry sorry give us another opportunity. thank you ritz buckhead for the lovely experience you provided us on our wedding anniversary. i am a platinum premier, top 2% i'm told, with over 100 nights per year to include other ritz properties but that obviously means nothing. i will call marriott customer care tomorrow and lodge my complaint. nothing will come of the complaint as the management at this property has a definite hearing problem. thank goodness the grand hyatt had rooms and greatly appreciated our business. i highly recommend this property over the motel 6 ritz.i have been going to the ritz carlton in buckhead for many years. it has always been a top-notch luxury getaway with impeccable service from the minute you arrive. it has been a year since i visited the ritz buckhead property, and all i can say is it is nothing like it used to be! i had a big birthday to celebrate, and i decided an old fashioned slumber party with my 3 best friends at the ritz would be perfect. i booked club level which was a first for me, because of the amenities that came with it. free drinks in a private lounge with food seemed worth the extra $350. i did not want my guests to have to pay for anything. the rooms on the club level have not been renovated. it looked like a ramada inn room. i was shocked at the difference in the quality of the room from my previous stays there. the special  club level lounge \" is exactly like the delta club room at the airport, except there is no free liquor or beer. that's right, only wine, champagne and soft drinks are available club level. there is no bartender, if you want a drink or a beer it has to be brought up from the downstairs bar. the food was sparse and not remotely special. chips, salsa, processed sliced lunch meat, horrendous. my stay cost $905. this was for one room with 2 occupants, for one night. we stayed about 2 hours in the club level lounge. huge disappointment for my 50th birthday. i will stay at the st. regis for all upcoming atlanta visits. the $905. covered just the club level room- valet parking, a coke from the mini- bar not included!\"i started staying at the rc buckhead when the hotel first opened. it was the most divine hotel i had been in with beautiful antiques, traditional decor and real\" attentive service. i remember the club lounge when it truly was not the \"cattle-call\" that it has become. i loved the place and everyone knew me and i never thought i would \"divorce\" the rc. i stayed there this weekend for the alabama/va. tech game and i am astonished at how far it has fallen. the\"new\" marriott style decor looks like a \"target collection\" for ritz carlton. the beautiful antique 18th and 19th century furniture, art work and accessories has been replaced with furnishings that look like target. it is all beyond my grasp. apparently all the reviews are being written by people who do not know the old ritz and how truly exceptional it was. i was greeted by all the old doormen and valets that worked there during the glory days and they are still the best employees they have. we had lunch in the cafe that used to be graced with fine china, cobalt blue glasses and white table cloths and is now a bland dining area with cheap wood floors, accessories and a breakfast buffet set-up that looks like a home depot building expo. horrible is the only way i can describe what used to be one of the most civilized dining venues in atlanta. not one thing i ate the entire time i was there was good except for a bowl of grits i had for breakfast an i had to endure the horrible dining room ambience that marriott has created for its level of clientele it services. i am so disappointed that this hotel is no longer the bastion of civility it used to be and i for one hope i never have to darken the doors that lead to the lobby that is now adorned with chandeliers with purple crystal! my deepest condolences to all those that used to adore this hotel as i did.\"i stayed at this hotel for two days recently while traveling for business. the hotel is very nice and in a good location if you need to be out in buckhead (not if you need to be in downtown/midtown atlanta), but i deducted a star because the on site restaurant and food options were not great.what a wonderful and perfect stay in buckhead. the hotel is elegant and the staff is so friendly and helpful from the time you arrive until you bid farewell. it is nice to feel appreciated and thanked for choosing their hotel above all others in the same citywhat a wonderful and perfect stay in buckhead. the hotel is elegant and the staff is so friendly and helpful from the time you arrive until you bid farewell. it is nice to feel appreciated and thanked for choosing their hotel above all others in the same city. even through the ritz in buckhead is a distance from downtown atlanta, the marta is so easy to get to with a quick walk to and from the hotel. there are great restaurants also near by if you do not want to eat at the hotel. i was in a corner room (the only way to go) with great views of the city. the room was large, comfy and very clean. the only negative of the hotel is that i left by mistake two pairs of gloves in the closet and didn't realize until i unpack, good gloves from northface, but the lost and found could not find! that is disappointing.i have never stayed in a hotel that only has the choice of one king or 2 full size beds! even the motel 6 has queen sized beds! the room was so small, they probably couldn't have squeezed in a couple of queen beds. the bathroom had barely enough room to enter and shut the door behind. the tiles in the shower had not been cleaned for quite some time. the toilet smelled of urine. the coffee pot in the room was old and beat up, and the outlet at the counter had a broken socket.the swimming pool was ok if you just played on the surface for a while, but 2 of us had chemical burns to our eyes after swimming for a couple of hours. one person was actually transported to the emergency room to have eyes rinsed at 3am after swimming -- a very unpleasant experience, ruining our plans the next day and basically ruining our trip. and we only stayed here for the indoor pool -- imagine that!we witnessed what could only have been a pimp and one of his girls ride up the elevator with us and our child, spewing profanities. at first they got off on another floor, but later we met up with them again on our floor, knocking on someone's door, still spewing profanities. a once in a lifetime experience for our child.our child's nintendo was left in the back seat of the car. when we returned from our trip several days later, we discovered that the nintendo was missing. when we called the hotel, they gave us to lost and found,\" where they had mysteriously found our nintendo. they are going to mail it to us, postage due, claiming that it was left in the room. how did it end up in \"lost and found\" if it was left in the room? why did no one call us if it was, indeed found in the room? be careful using the valet -- there are about 10 of them loitering about outside the door at any one time, very friendly, but they will take your inconsequential stuff.one positive was the food in the cafe -- the breakfast was very good. the staff was always very nice -- it's not their fault that the hotel is old and substandard for a ritz carlton. the ritz in denver and aspen simply blow this one away. i also have to admit that the management has so far been very nice in getting to the bottom of the swimming pool incident, and seem to be taking it seriously.\"not stayed in a ritz carlton before so wasn't sure what to expect. travelled on business and stayed here for last night before departure but managed a few hours in shopping mall across the road from hotel before heading to airport. very high quality hotel from staff, rooms, atmosphere, location and overall interior of hotel.the lobby hallways and room had been fresher since my last visit.room was comfortable, with a good size desk, easy to access plugs for chargers and wireless that was fast and free.valets and bell staff were very effeicient and very friendly. front desk and concierge adequate. room service was prompt, delivery staff friendly but food not up to par. a cream of cauliflower soup was awful, wat too much salt pork and butter, very little cauliflower. rolls were neither warm nor fresh. a request for mango baffled the team.room could have been cleaner, but nothing a package of antibacterial wipes didn't fix. there was no laundry bag in the room and housekeeper seemed upset by having to find one on her cart.location is very comvient.i liked the quaint rooms but the hags in the spa and club level were snotty and rude to the other employees. i saw a roach in the lobby lounge! might have been a nice place in the day but needs to be bulldozed now!i enjoyed staying here for business. the business center\" was pretty worthless, but otherwise i used the gym, pool, sauna, restaurant, and bar on my week long stay.the one serious problem i had that keeps me from giving this an \"excellent\" rating was that the walls were paper thin. at 4 am on a tuesday morning, a loud crowd of people were milling around for a while. i am a very heavy sleeper, but because the walls offered no sound proofing at all, i was kept awake for a while.\"the rooms are nicer and the food is better, but not the best location! we stayed here over thanksgiving and the lunch buffett was wonderful. the gym was nice but the steam room was broken, which was disappointing.i have stayed at both ritz carltons in atlanta, oddly they appear to be of the same design even if from the street there outward appearance appears to be very different. the biggest asset of the rc buckhead is the location. my wife use to choose the downtown location for when she joined me on biz trips, but since the macy's downtown closed a few years ago, she now prefers the location in buckhead. first this is a ritz in the truest sense of the word and the location accross the street from the lenox square mall is a real plus for the wife. also, now that they have finished construction on the new city center area of buckhead, there is now many restaurants on the same side of the street within a short walk. the rooms are pretty rc standard and the lobby is as well. the view is of either buckhead or the mall and you have the option of either valet or pretty reasonable offsite parking imediatley adjacent to the hotel. buckhead is the trendy, party, restaurant section of north atlanta and shops are everywhere. i ussually drive, but the marta goes straight from the airport to buckhead, where the station is only a short distance from the ritz. the biggest plus to this hotel is the weekend rates in atlanta, you can easily find rates for less than $150.00 a night and on occasion for even less. so, if you are looking for that extra accent on a biz trip or that weekend shopping trip to atlanta, the ritz buckhead just might be the exclamation point on a great visit to hotlanta!this is the first time i have ever written a review. it should be shared. our family has stayed at a couple of other ritz carlton properties in the past and was expecting the same quality at their buckhead hotel. unfortunately, this was not the case. check in was courteous and efficient. the problem mainly was with the condition of the room itself and the fact that nothing was done about it. we stayed for two nights. as we looked around the room, it was one thing after another. besides, the room was fairly small with a very standard bathroom. the tv stand was covered with dust, there were fingerprints on both sides of the bathroom door, there was a cheerio on the floor left be a previous guest, the granite top had a gunky ring stain that had not been cleaned, missing remote control, the in-room coffee was missing sugar and creamer with only decaf, the bathroom door squeaked so loudly, there was a light missing by the front door, and to top it off - no pen anywhere to write these down. after the first night, we brought the list of complaints to the manager. he gave us breakfast complimentary (which by the way was fantastic, as was the service.) he also assured us that housekeeping and engineering would be notified right away. to our disbelief upon returning after a day out, none of the above were addressed. to top it off, an extra charge showed up on our credit card for the valet parking which was supposed to be included. after emailing and calling twice, i got it straightened out.we chose to stay at the ritz the evening of our wedding because we believed it would be a luxurious and romantic experience. the room was fine, and they even gave us champagne and sprinkled rose petals on the bed. the problem was that we were woken up very early by loud construction noise coming from inside the hotel- hardly romantic!when we went to check out the woman at the desk asked us how our stay was and i said we were woken up by all the noise. i was expecting they would offer to at least refund us some of the steep cost, but the woman instead just disinterestedly said oh, i'm so sorry to hear that\" as if she didn't care at all (which made me wonder why she even bothered asking!). clearly they had known we were on our honeymoon- i don't understand why they didn't give us a room away from the construction noise!the ritz used to be an elegant hotel, where you could expect to feel pampered, but now it seems to cater mostly to people on business trips and is run by the marriott. they used to have an elegant afternoon tea, but the last time i went there for tea there were loud, drunk business men. my advice is if you want a true luxury hotel experience stay at the four seasons in midtown. the ritz is no longer worth what they are charging.\"pretty consistent with many of the other reviewers, i would say this specific property is my biggest rc disappointment. my room could not have been representative, it was that bad. about 300 sq. ft., worn, paint peeling, mold in the shower, a bathroom several steps below acceptable...felt like staying at grandma's apartment! even the common areas just look very tired and worn. did not try the restaurant but the gym was ok. we left after one night and went to the jw marriott. no, the jwm is not an equal to a rc in most cases, but in this case it was overall more comfortable hands down...they did a much better job at being a jwm than the buckhead ritz did at being a rc.the filthiest bathroom i have ever seen- started with a small shower- mold on the tiles- and in less than 10 mins was standing in chin high water. now please tell me how they clean their bathtubs?had booked on-line- usinf a credit card- got a confirmation ##-recieved an email and then a fax, requesting a credit card to prepay the entire visit because it was market week.\" after checking in and experiencing this horrible shower, i get a call asking for a credit card to charge $400 for incidentals!! is this the ritz or a scam.tell the assistant manager i'm in my p.j.'s and she proceeds to ask if i can come down to the lobby so she can make an imprint of the card! no, how about sending an engineer to unclog the shower? that takes 3 visits and an electric snake- with no housekeeping following behind to clean up- thank just what i want to do at 11 oclock at night.!request a room change the next morning- to a cleaner room- get down graded to an even smaller, lower level floor- but \"mr. nabers\" \"welcome cookies\" were nice.bathroom amenties were lacking- only 1 soap- 3 towels for 2 people- the bathroom was a little cleaner- but looks like someone used toothpaste to chalk around the light over the shower.the walls are paper thin- folks next door had a great party 'til 1am- sounded like it had spilt out into the hall- but they were all in the room.the in room dining lacks luster. there was action at the bar- totally packed- but hot.there was no one- neither coming or going to hold the door open for you.we're still here- i usually check reviews before we go- but who'd thought you'd have to check on a 5 star hotel. so here i am warning others- i've stayed at 3 start hotel in atlanta that are far superior!!\"i'm a huge fan of ritz carlton hotels. i'm 34 and very well traveled. i've stayed at the ritz in buckhead many times. i'm not sure i'll be back.my children (9, 7 and 5), my mother (58), and i checked into the ritz at 3:00 p.m. on a friday afternoon. we didn't go directly to the rooms. we had 4:00 p.m. tickets to the georgia aquarium.when we arrived back at the hotel and went to our rooms at around 6:30 p.m. we were tired and ready to relax. we had too connecting rooms. we all got into our beds to rest and boy was i in for a surprise.we had been resting for about an hour, watching tv. my 5 year old was in my king bed. i was adjusting the coverlet when i noticed a small blood stain. then another. then another. then i got up and check the sheets. dirty!well, i was disgusted. i called housekeeping right away. security came to take away the dirty sheets and the coverlet. he apologized for the inconvenience.\" it then took and hour before someone came with clean sheets. at around 9:00 p.m. the head of housekeeping called to apologize and say she was embarrassed. the manager sent a bottle of red wine as an apology. we we're still charged full price for the room, which surprised me. i mean, my child laid in someone else's blood!it was a huge disappointment.\"felt like i was staying in a holiday inn. the room looks like it had not been redone in 10 years, the bathroom was old and seemed dingy, and the service was not worthy of a ritz-carlton. as someone who is fortunate to stay regularly in ritz-carlton's, this is one i would pass up in the future (as i would the sister property downtown). i hear ritz-carlton's are individually owned- i hope this franchisee gets his act together.unworthy of the name. i have traveled for business for over 4 years, and have stayed in over 200 different hotels. when i got a good rate at the ritz-carlton in buckhead, in atlanta, i was excited. sorry to say, but the room was average in terms of comfort, the staff was less than friendly, and the room-service food was just bad.walked into room which looked generally clean until discovered a used q-tip on the bathroom floor. grouting etc clearly not updated in a long time. actively solicited newspaper choice, but then no newspaper in the morning. nothing shocking, and the bed was very comfortable, but far below ritz-carlton standards.we chose this hotel for our 5-day stay because of the ritz carlton's reputation for superb service. this hotel's guest rooms were lovely but small, as was the bathroom and closet. i would have overlooked that if they had provided good service. but that was not the case. housekeeping had trouble providing even basic service (e.g. cleaning the room on time, providing daily room amenities). additional requests were a real difficulty -- after 3 phone calls asking to have our room service trolley removed, we finally just put it in the hall. and shoes sent out for a complementary shine were returned much later than promised, causing a significant problem in dressing for an event.the high point was the food -- superb meals and the most elaborate sunday brunch we'd ever seen. i suggest dining at the ritz but staying somewhere else.we recently stayed at the ritz in buckhead and i was so dissapointed. i had taken clients to visit atlanta and see a braves ballgame and knew the ritz would be the hotel to impress. boy was i wrong. the check-in counter was so loud you had to shout so the clerk could hear you, the rooms were not at all up to our usual ritz standards. they were small with a standard bathroom. i host conferences all over the us in ritz carltons and this was not at all what i was expecting. our rooms were not cleaned until after 5 pm (and we were on 3 different floors) and the service just was not at all present. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone and if i were the ritz, i would definitely look into selling this property.while for the most part i've found ritz carlton to quite nice the rc in buckhead was disappointing. not from a service standpoint by any means, the staff was great. its the physical building. it's very dated and i'm sure in its heyday in the 80's it was quite the place to see and be seen. tired and dark corridoors. bathrooms rather small and i was in an executive suite. food was quite good although i stayed away from the afternoon tea\" in the lobby. lot's of \"wanna be's\" dishing out attitude. cheap and flashy clothing. lot's of e class mercedes, land rover discoverys and 5 series bwm's. all poor man's versions of luxury cars. many patrons with champagne taste on a beer budget. i suspect they were locals not actually staying at the hotel...just spending the evening away from the trailer park!\"very nice staff but very uncomfortable rooms. tramway runs under the hotel and i could hear it even at the 14th floor. investing in soundproofing the windows may be helpful. also, the fan is so loud, it was like trying to sleep next to an airplane engine. food at the hotel was below average. would definitely look elsewhere next time i am in atlanta.after long flight from uk,room was not ready at approx 4.30pm. we went for a walk with promise that they would call us but in the end we went back to the hotel and waited in reception. after asking politely a couple of times and other people getting their rooms we eventually got our room at about 5.30pm,with no apology. lift was having problems, room was tired and ensuite shabby.the bed however was comfortable. we were glad to leave in the morning and paid for the one bottle of water in cash on checkout. annoyingly we have also been charged again on our credit card for the water, i emailed and asked for refund but received nothing. it's only a couple of dollars and i wouldn't normally bother but given that the service was so bad i requested a refund on principle. we booked via virgin holidays would've hoped for better.this is the first negative review i have ever left on trip advisor. our terrible experience started from the moment we showed up to ‚äúvalet parking‚äù with no where to park and no valets in sight. it was an extremely busy weekend in atlanta and everyone was showing up for the 3pm check-in so we weren‚äôt upset as we were hoping they were trying their best. our patience continued when our room wasn‚äôt available and we waited in the lobby for over two hours on our room to be ready. countless people that came in after us were getting rooms and the lobby cleared out with only us remaining. we were even told we couldn‚äôt wait in the bar area because we had suitcases with wheels so we sat in a corner. throughout the 2 hours i politely checked a few times to make sure we hadn‚äôt been overlooked and asked for free bar vouchers for our inconvenience. the manager on duty (i don‚äôt know her name but she was shorter with a caribbean accent) was extremely rude and offered no assistance. long story short - we were overlooked - we never even received an apology. did i mention one of two elevators wasn‚äôt working?at this point, i‚äôm done with being frustrated and i was ready to enjoy my evening at an amazing p!nk concert.we got back to the hotel around midnight to no working ac and a bed as hard as a rock with the cheapest, flattest pillows in the world. we were so miserable we left at 4 am and drove home on no sleep. even at 4 am the valet didn‚äôt offer to help us with our bags. this will be my first and last stay at the ‚äúhell-ish‚äù hotel. aka the tower of terror.i will note that lj (who had only worked there for 9 days at the time) was very friendly and i was impressed with her positive attitude on a busy and stressful afternoon. daniel at the bar was also very nice. they are the only reason this hotel gets two stars from me. one for each of them :)stayed in this hotel for volleyball. room was tiny. beds tiny. air conditioning did not work. called maintenance two separate days and they said that they would look at it never did. we could not sleep it was so hot. will never stay there again . room was also not very clean. . staff not knowledgeable. no one would follow up in issues. the manager was also not receptive to comments or complaints. would never stay here. valet guys were nice. for the record i have never written a bad review for anything.the personnel at the ellis hotel were fantastic. my husband was in the hospital while in atlanta and everyone asked about him and helped me in every way possible. i was a bit disappointed in the room--recurring problems with the tv, the phone battery being down.when we arrived there was a homeless man that was passed out in front of the doorway. to which the valet attendants started pouring water on the man's head while videotaping it. they were so taken with this that they then ran in to my 9 month old son. the room itself was ok, very small however. we were supposed to have a king size bed and were only given a queen. we were then kept up all night by the traffic noise as the hotel is right on the street and people were constantly revving their engines and blaring their music. it's not a place we would visit again.there were lots of small things that added up to an experience that was not enjoyable.the lighting in the room was bright white bulbs, it's harsh on the eyes and i did not want to spend much time in my room. on the other hand the lights in the bathroom were warm and very dim-- making it hard to see. would love to swap out those lights.tv only had analogue channels, i've never been in a hotel that didn't have digital channels. furniture is a little warn, but bed was comfortable.the restaurant is small and dining room is cave like. no one else was there eating while i was there. after placing my order the bartender and server both left. not sure where they went. when my food came it was fine, food was hot. server was nice. not a place where i would want to spend any more time than i had to. during my stay at the hotel i saw several people walk into the restaurant and turn right back around to leave.i checked out the gym and there is everything you need, although all the lights were off when i went, adding to the deserted hotel vibe.location is close to marta.not sure how they won a reader's choice from conde nast. i felt like the hotel i saw online was not the one i stayed at. i would not stay here again.one of the worst hotels i've stayed in and i've stayed in hotels across the country as well as europe. the best part was the valet. the guys were extremely nice. the first room we were given was so small we could barely turnaround. it was just me and my best girlfriend. the noise was so loud that we could literally hear the people talking out side and we were on the 8th floor! for $20 extra a night we could switch to a better room so we did that. we had to get some sleep. the room was ok, not worth the $20 extra a night but it was slightly quieter. we left the do not disturb sign on our door the entire 3 night stay. we came in one afternoon and noticed the towels were gone. we called the front desk and long story short, no one could tell us who or why someone was in our room. they didn't leave any more towels, just took ours, turned the air way down (and it was cold out!) and left. someone was supposed to contact us and let us know why someone came up but no one ever did.the housekeeping was very loud. the storage room was at the other end of the hall and housekeeping were constantly slamming the store and it was loud! all hours they did this.the tv kept skipping, not good quality.the beds weren't very comfortable, very hard.the bathroom ceiling was peeling. not sure how well everything was actually cleaned.i was overcharged. i had booked several months in advance. if i booked three or more nights i could get 15% off. when i went to check out, the bill was way more than i expected. the lady at the front desk had to check with the manager to see why the price was higher than the confirmation email i showed her. the manager called me back and claimed my card declined when he tried to run it. i never saw the email. it would have been nice if he had called me. ive never had a problem with my card, it was probably because i was from out of town. either way, he was able to run the same card at a later time for a higher price. he sent me an email saying they decided to offer a 10% credit as a goodwill for issues at the time of booking\". so i still paid more than i agreed to. i would not have stayed all three nights if i knew i would have to pay this much. this on top of the $20 extra a night. i wouldn't have stayed one night if i knew about this.will never stay here again.\"not at all boutique. the ellis was selected for us by the convention staff of a large medical conference we were attending. we asked for a four-star hotel or higher. we were told that the ellis was a boutique hotel that was right in the heart of the area. that was absolutely correct. however, being across the street from the ritz carlton the ellis should've been in much much better shape insidethe staff is great and location is wonderful. however, due to noise from outside and what sounded like other guests taking showers all night long, it was a horrible stay for me. bed felt as if it had no cushioning at all and hvac system struggled to maintain a consistent temperature in the room.the entire hotel woke up to cold showers one morning. the staff seemed indifferent to it; of course they probably had a warm shower in their homes.the breakfast i had on campus was greasy, over cooked and not very good. very disappointing.3day/2night parental escape to taste of atlanta 2017 (4th ward park).nicely updated and maintained old school hotel.........mattress, hot water, wifi, flat screen, hvac, fast elevator, front desk staff.......all get high marks no problems here..just fine !!........only frown was the parking situation, you can self-park 1 block away (1148pm in fri....(no movements)..1050am out sun =$48). or use the separate 3rd party valet for $30/day....typical off-property rates for most major cities.........cabs...uber...walk...metro..lyft... are plenty.......rarely move my vehicle when in town..........front desk team member nickole was nice and very helpful......no problems or concerns returning to this sitepoor due to cleanliness and comfort. the staff was pleasant. the location was very good. the restaurant was average. our room was upgraded to the women's floor\", which was not impressive. the only difference was the room included a flat iron. we were disappointed as the hotel website reflected a travel magazine award.\"they tried to squeeze too many rooms in. my room had a shared door to another room with a large gap at the bottom. you could see straight in, plus light & sound came thru. could hear everything in the hall which was busy until 3a. there were also sketchy cracks in the ceiling right above the head of the bed.travelled recently and was the only hotel i stayed at on the trip. next day had over a 100 bites over my legs and arms. reached out to the company but never heard back. would clearly avoid until they get this under control. beyond the bugs, this is a small boutique hotel with nice staff but exceptionally small, standard rooms.the only snag was that there was too much of a sense that a tip was mandatory. i wanted to give the bell boy a tip, but had to rush off as i was late for an event , and he started counting dollars from his pocket in front of me. even though i would've given the tip were i not in a hurry, i was put off, by that gesture.the lady at the concierge the day i arrived, gave me a room upgrade, because i arrived ahead of check-in time, and my room was not ready. she also said she would only hold $50. eventually, i recieved a bank notice showing that she not only held the total amount for my 5-day stay, but also a total of $250, being a $50/day incidental. no hotel has ever done that to me. i wondered if she also expected a tip. it never occurred to me to give her a tip because i regarded her highly. i would personally feel insulted if someone gave me a tip on my job! itsdespite its glitzy appearance, the ellis hotel is not only overpriced, most of its clientele are also difficult to deal with. so although the ellis hotel may seem like a great place for your vacation or travel needs, you better be ready to handle the type of people who stay there.i travel frequently for business, and i have stayed at hotels across the price range so i know what is reasonable and not. i was at the ellis for four nights and 5 days. my stay at the ellis was pretty bad, and here's why: upon entering my room, i found hair in the tub, sink, and toilet. later, i found more hair on the sheets. the breakfast order card (for ordering in-room dining to be delivered the next day) only appeared in my room on one day - once i used it, it was never replaced. i ordered breakfast, and it never came.the iron and ironing board was always left out. on the three days that the sheets were not changed, the bedding was just yanked up to the pillows (not made\"). the minibar was not restocked once. a coffee spill was left untouched on the desk, and i think the one day the cups were not clean (just wiped out).and worst of all: every day my key had to be recoded. on one afternoon, i had to get it recoded 4 times while the front desk staff just did it over and over again - not investigating, not apologizing. nicole at the front desk was extremely helpful, while her boss kalvin was rude, demeaning, and downright unprofessional. and the elevator takes forever. i did speak with multiple managers several times who had lots of apologies. though they took no steps to rectify the housekeeping problems.i dined in the restaurant twice on my stay and enjoyed conversation with the manager, matthew. shanance was my server and she was attentive, personable, and gave great service. i began my meal with a drink at the bar with the bartender (randy i believe) she made it very obvious she did not want to work. when i walked in she was sitting at the bar on a bar stool. she was complaining to the other server about another guest in the restaurant. it took her 22 minutes to get my drink and i asked for a glass of wine. maybe she was having a bad day, but the way she treated myself as well as others at the bar was ridiculousif i hadn't bought the trip on travelocity, i would have left on day 2. taken all together, who needs this kind of hassle? there are lots of other hotels within walking distance of this one - i would never return here.\"check in went smoothly and then things quickly went down hill once we got to the room. raw holes in the walls where paintings were moved,stains on one wall and when we ordered room service it was delivered with old, dried sauce from another order. very clear they hadn't even washed the lid/tray used for our food.checking out the next day i nearly tripped over a coffee dispenser left outside the elevator in the lobby. when we noted it to reception, she simply walked over, moved it next to a chair and left it there. during checkout receptionist barely spoke to us, and what she did say was hard to hear as she was blasting music from behind the counterrooms were filthy. housekeeping clearly doesn't know how to dust or clean. empty bottlecaps from previous guests on windowsill, dirty bathrooms, hair from previous guest on bedsheets. i couldnt wait to check out!!the hotel was quite nice in the lobby, the restaurant and the rooms. it's location near the peachtree metro was perfect for a short stay as i was not going to rent a car.despite these pluses, the lasting impression was one of poor management and incorrect billing. the hotel put an invoice under my door with a valet charge and a bottle of water. the only problem is that i had neither a car outside, nor a minibar in my room. the front desk removed the charges upon check out and i signed nothing as my room was prepaid. a few days later, i find the charge on my credit card statement. i call the hotel to find out how and why this was charged. the woman on the phone was a bit surly as if she were bothered that i would call for such small charges and said it was already credited back to the card. to date i have not seen the credit. i wonder how often these 'small charges' get billed and people just shrug it off saying: well it's not a big amount.most distressingly, i was unable to discern how the hotel charged my card without my signature. i never signed a credit card authorization nor an invoice/bill.the incorrect billing along with lax controls on charging cards that are only swiped for authorization would make me uncomfortable staying here again unless i was somehow paying in cash. it's a shame really as the property is not bad at all.this was our conference hotel, so i stayed, and will not again.pros:* free wifi at least worked* fantastic downtown locationcons:* main issue: housekeeping is very suspect. my first night, there was no blanket in my room. my 2nd night, after cleanup, i found a giant hairball on my 'new' sheets. ewww. 3rd, i asked for a do not disturb sign twice, and never got it.* staff makes mistakes too. i had to re-sign the agreement sheet, because they lost the one i signed at check in. seriously?* rooms are not quiet at all. there's ambient street noise always which isn't the hotel's fault, but the old rumbly ac system is.* the shower has serious issues in design, such that when you come out, the floor is sopping wet.* parking valet is $30/night. breakfast is not included and expensive.* no pool either, but rooms still expensive.lot of noise between rooms and the air conditioner sounds like a falling plane, each time it stars it will wake you up, this hotel is not for the people that his main travel purpose is to rest and have a quiet nighthe hotel was overpriced for the service we received. the room service which we ordered the night before to arrive no later than 7:15 arrived close to 8 am, i was not able to eat it since i had to go to my business conference. i was still billed the $50 for that. the hotel also smelled like baby wipes when you came in to the lobby. i could not wait until i got to my room to open the window!. never staying there again.the room is very small and the bathroom too. the ac doesn't work!!! the staff was very kind. if will recommend this hotel? no i don't. the breakfast was very expensive to the taste. the hotel is located very welli used to stay at the ellis a lot--it was a great alternative to larger hotels on peachtree. it's been about 4 years and whoa was i disappointed. this place hasn't aged well. stinky, smelly lobby, too hot in shared spaces and hallways. room was fine but overall impression is that it needs some tlc, stat.if the management were as polite and efficient as the car parking attendants and desk crew, this would be a better experience. you can get a full city of atlanta experience within walking distance from this location.i stayed here for four nights, and the hotel is in a very convenient location in downtown atlanta. very close (walking distance) to a lot of very big attractions.the mattress did not have a cover between the mattress and the fitted sheet, so when you lay on the bed, the fitted sheet comes off the mattress exposing the mattress in it's raw state (which is kind of gross, just knowing other people have slept in that bed. when i called the front desk about it, they brought me up a flat sheet, and not a fitted sheet that actually fit, and just handed it to me.... instead of taking charge and fixing it for me... that was fine, so i took the flat sheet and covered the mattress with that which fixed the issue (minus the mattress cover).beware, that the water bottles in the room are $2.00 a piece. there isn't a sign or any instructions on this, unless you ask the front desk.the hotel downstairs is horrible, except for breakfast. i ordered about $100 worth of food from there via room service, and everything i order was just not good at all. for the price, i was very disappointed. i did not have the breakfast, but my coworkers said that it was very good. not to mention they just bring it to you on a tray, and there really isn't any place in the room to put the tray to eat the food, so i had them put it on the end of my bed, which is just awkward, and wrong. there is a little desk area, but it was in the corner of the table the tv was on... so not much room.rarely do i have a bad experience at a hotel. i usually will overlook most things and focus on the positives. unfortunately, my stay at the ellis hotel was a bad experience. i stayed one night, and wanted to stay in downtown atlanta to be able to walk to my business meeting. i understood this was a boutique hotel so i was ready for an experience different than a mainstream hotel. when i arrived i quickly understood that the ellis is an old tenement building that was refurbished. so, i was ready for the small rooms, etc. but i was still a little taken aback by the small and closed-in feeling of the hallways, doors and room. you really get the impression of what these apartments may have once looked and felt like in the day. the ceilings are vey low. the phone was very unclean. it was clear it had not been cleaned or wiped down in a while. it also did not work (the wireless receiver charging plate was broken). it did not even have any kind of hotel information on it. i was hungry and wanted to order room service. i used by cell phone and called the hotel number directly. i informed them about the phone and they transferred me to room service. they sent a maintenance man to look at the phone. the guy was super nice and immediately saw the problem (and said that i should have had a different phone with all the hotel info on it). the handset had to charge on its new base, i suppose, but it never worked while i was there. room service took an hour and 10 minutes to arrive. i ordered the steak (medium) and fries. their menu says they have v8 juice, but they said they did not have any when i tried to order it. i unwrapped the plastic and found that my steak had been burnt to a crisp. there is no way a cook could have thought that this steak was edible. they told me to put the tray outside and someone would retrieve it. it stayed there all night. the glasses in the room had hand prints on them. i did not use them. i had an early meeting, so i filled out the card provided to order breakfast and hung it on the door. i order the cr√®me brulee french toast and checked the box to arrive between 8 and 8:15. by 8:30 i had to leave. my breakfast never showed. so, i left for my meeting hungry and disappointed.i have to give an incredible shout out to ms. eileen at the front desk of the ellis, atlanta. after this crazy bridge collapse this evening, i was forced to change my reservation from a perimeter starwood property to a marriott property downtown (ritz carlton). only problem, no glasses in the car in traffic and booked for tomorrow. needles to say, when i showed up, you got it, not one single room. i walked across the street and eileen went right to work trying to get me a room. we finally found one, but what so impressed me was the commitment she showed to take care of me, my luggage, my car, and etc... some folks in hospitality don't get it\". she does in a way that the ellis better be paying attention to. this classy lady will get snatched up with her level of service and compassion. thank you eileen. you kept your word and i really appreciate it. dr. jim barrett\"hotel was great but didn't feel safe after walking a few blocks from the hotel toward the center of downtown. no,shopping at all near the hotel. walked to underground atlanta which was swarming with gang activity. we were terrified once we got there and couldn't get back fast enough.this was by far the worst experience i've had in a hotel, and i travel often for business worldwide. first night, the heater didn't work. i called reception at 6 am because my room was so cold. i was told the engineer was not available, so i had to wait until he comes to work. my plan to work in my room was ruined, so i left to find a cafe. when i returned at in the afternoon, the room was still cold. finally the engineer came at 5 pm, messed with the heater for 15 mins, then said it should be fixed now. for the next 2 hrs, the room stayed at the same temperature even though the heater was blowing like crazy. eventually the hotel moved me to a new room.night 2 (in a new room), the heater blew like crazy every 15 mins. imagine trying to sleep with a leaf blower next to you. temperature was good but the room was so noisy. then the ceiling started leaking. the drip-drip noise was loud and next to the bed. i called receptionist at 5 am, and these people could only offer me a free breakfast buffet. they said the manager does not come to work until 9 am. i got very fed up and checked out. emailing the manager later was useless since he only informed me that he has contacted the engineer. what's the point? i've already checked out the hotel, do i care if he contacted the engineer?if you wish to pay over $200+ per night for a room that you cannot even sleep or work in, good luck! customer service was dismal. breakfast buffet was also unappetizing. what buffet asks you to pay for cappucino?i recently was at this hotel for business purposes. i checked in on a sunday, was able to work in my room with high speed internet and had a great dinner on the property. if you stay at the ellis, do not go anywhere else to eat. the patio of the restaurant is premier and the food is to die for. once you check in, you will not want to go anywhere else.chose this hotel for the convenience to the atlanta mart. parking is a challenge as it is basically a traffic lane that has been designated for valet...makes getting in and out of your vehicle dangerous, however, there seems to be no other solution for this. the room was made up but all aspects of the room needed cleaning. the carpet was filthy and the tile in the bathroom was in desperate need of cleaning. the room was fairly quiet and the front desk staff upon check in was extremely friendly. while i wanted to like this hotel i was disappointed.this is not an elite hotel. it is similar to holiday inn express in quality. the staff was nice and helpful but the rooms are small, the fan on the heat sounded like a jet engine all night. bathroom was small. shower would not stay on.first of all i should say, the staff were simply wonderful. always friendly, always smiling, always helpful. i've met great hotel staff before, but the staff at the ellis took it to another level. the location is fantastic as well (provided you need to be in downtown atlanta).now the downside(s)... the room seemed dated, but more importantly, the bathroom was far from clean and in fact, seemed to be slightly worse after the room had allegedly been cleaned. to add to that, the a/c couldn't be turned off (even staff tried) and while we managed to increase the temperature, the unit kept blowing air all the time. a simple 'off switch' shouldn't be too much to ask. i also wasn't impressed with the sheets or the lack thereof. i don't find it very hygienic to sleep with a duvet that has a sheet lying on top, but isn't entirely covered with one. whether or not the duvets get washed is irrelevant. i doubt it, but i don't know it and won't want to sleep with a largely coverless duvet that someone has just used before me.the biggest thing that this hotel has going for it was the attentiveness of the staff - they are always smiling and gracious at every interaction. this small hotel in atlanta's business district is a little difficult to access if you're driving - there's only a couple of spots for valet drop off, and the apparently not enough valet staff - i drove around the block 10 or more times before i was able to leave the car,the rooms are small, but comfortably furnished. i was at the back of the hotel, and while my view dismal (a brick wall for the neighboring hotel), the room was very quiet. colleagues staying on rooms facing peachtree st complained of the noise, but not a problem for me.the only complaint was that the housekeeping was a little off - although they picked up towels and hand cloths, they didn't replace them - since i was the only guest in the room it was not a problem, but if sharing it would have been. they also failed to restock the coffee and related supplies - i'm an early riser and need my several cups of coffee - i use three the first morning, and only had one coffee pack the following day. i did not contact the front desk with any complaints, however, as i figured i could manage.even thought a few problems, i'd return in a heartbeat!my husband and i stayed here for one night. overall the room was clean and the staff was polite. we ran into problems almost immediately after going to our room. the shower head was dangling from the nozzle and when you turned it on, water sprayed on the ceiling. my husband tried to call the front desk and wasn't able to get ahold of anyone, so he had to go downstairs to speak with someone. instead of just switching our room, we were told to wait for the handy man and so we had to wait 10 minutes on him, and then another awkward 20 minutes while he wandered in and out of the room getting parts for the shower head. this whole time delay made us late for the reservations we had.additional cons:-the walls were thin- you can hear your neighbors talking.-the wifi is terrible- i turned my data on because it is so bad.-every time we called the front desk, we got a busy signal and couldn't get through.-the hallways smell odd, not really bad but definitely not great.-the king\" bed seems a little smaller than a standard king.-the rooms don't have hair dryers or a mini fridge-the down comforter had yellow stainsultimately, if you are able to get a good deal on the room it is nice and comfortable enough. we were very unhappy with the way that the shower head situation was handled- we definitely will not be staying again or recommending it to others.\"the hotel itself isn't bad, but the service totally ruined it. i liked the room and the value was certainly there, but...check-in was ok, the front desk person was not friendly but certainly not bad. it was checkout. there was a problem with the tv in our room and it has charged us for movies that we didn't watch. we looked at the history on the bill and the movies were watched at times that we were in the hotel bar and not in the room. i literally pulled out the receipt for the hotel bar and was expecting the misunderstanding to be taken care of. however, it wasn't. they left the charges on and told me that they needed to review the security tapes from the bar and have a manager get back to me. i had to call the hotel twice the following week to make sure the charge was removed. we won't be back.let me start by saying, i don't normally write reviews. that said, i would like to share my observations/pros/cons because we left the ellis with very mixed feelings.pros:-very friendly and helpful staff. they were all very respectful.-the location is unbeatable. this place is in the heart of downtown close to restaurants, bars, and you literally walk out the door and have all the transit options at your immediate disposal (street car, subway, walking, cabs, busses).-free hour derves and $1 wine from 5:30-6.-the price of this hotel including parking was one of the cheapest for the downtown area.cons:-cleanliness was seriously lacking. black mold in the shower! gross. our toilet had hairs (more than one) on the seat when we arrived, and the toilet was not cleaned for the rest of our stay.-the maid service came midmorning (around 10 or 10:30). we were almost ready to leave so we asked them to come back in 20 min. when we returned to our room later, it looked like they never came because the bed wasn't made and there were no fresh towels or toiletries or evidence of them coming, until we noticed the bottled water had been replaced. very strange that they would replace the bottled water and do nothing else.-the breakfast buffet is supposed to go until 11 on weekends. we arrived at 10:30 to find it had already been taken down.-the carpeting was in need of repair or replacement, it was no longer glued down to the floor and had major ripples in it.-there wasn't much room to pull over on the curb for the valet parking, so it was a little stressful trying to park in such heavy traffic.telephones are not high tech, but they seem beyond the staff of the ellis. didn't get requested afternoon wake up call. two days straight, my husband was on hold for a total of over 35 minutes during three attempted efforts to reach my room and he never was put through (the wonderful thing is that cell phones track the time, so he knew exactly how long he was put on hold with each call). the front desk seemed to not care when he complained to them, which was irritating. the air conditioning was loud. the gym was pretty basic. on the up side, the bed was comfortable, the room pretty and the shower good. just don't expect to get anything as exotic as a phone call put through.a 1 day get away with someone very special was nearly wrecked by this terrible hotel and it's business practices. that the trip was salvaged and great memories were made despite the ellis' attempt to scuttle us is a testament to the two of us.... and i travel more nights than i stay at home over the course of the year.with reservations over 2 months in advance for 2 nights, at over $400 per night, our flight to atlanta ended with a call from the ellis at nearly 10 pm while deplaning to let us know that our room had been given to other guests who decided to extend their stay\". they must have been using better money than me because i was paying full rate for my reservation. the staff offered to \"pay for a room at an airport hotel, one meal, cabfare, and not charge me for the room at the ellis for the second night of my stay\". as angry as we were, given that we had flown to atlanta to spend one full day in the downtown area then see our favorite comedian at the tabernacle (2 blocks from the ellis), we had no choice but to comply as there were no other rooms downtown. we were shuttled through an unbelievably bad neighborhood to a terrible airport hotel that had significant cleanliness issues and....our room was close enough to the arrival runway at atl to see facial expressions on the passengers in the windows of planes as they landed....so...with the dawn of a new day we reset and arrived (again) at the ellis, where we were informed that no one ever promised us that our night there would be free (which they had promised multiple times on the call to bump us) and were charged full rate (over $400) for a marginal, tiny, loud hotel room at best for that price (we routinely stay at 5 star hotels and private access floors of top resorts)...shocked as we were we just paid it to stay positive and move on....at the time of arrival, while the staff refused to honor the previous night's promise above we were also told we would receive a \"voucher for a free night at the ellis on a future stay\" (not that we would have dared use it).... of course even that promise rang empty as we arrived back after the show that night to a card from the manager stating to \"call him before a future stay so he could make it special for us\".....no mention of a free stay of course...as a diamond elite member of a worldwide top hotel chain who stays in hotels 200 nights a year, i was appalled at our treatment by this \"boutique\" hotel. atlanta travelers heed our warning and stay elsewhere!!!!!\"by calling themselves 'boutique hotel' they seemed to use this a s an excuse to cut corners. the room was ok but the public areas were poor, the bar and dining area were soulless. free wifi was intermittent and sometimes non-existent. my flight home was late afternoon so i asked for a late check out (just 1 hour later) and this was refused....is this any way to treat guests? it is in a good location and right next to the marta station but i will not be staying there again.there was an issue with the online booking done through a third party, otel.com. they somehow made the booking for a date that was prior to when we even arrived in the city, a date we would never have searched because of our itinerary. that being said, we do realize our culpability in not checking closely enough when we received the confirmation email. i called on three occasions trying to speak to a manager and none of the staff, including the manager, were willing to assist at all with helping me with trying to still stay there for the weekend i had booked that i was willing to pay for. they received payment for a stay that i didn't have. had i not prepaid for my stay, and didn't show up, i would never have had to pay for it because they wouldn't have had my credit information. i'm extremely disappointed in the lack of service. we were down there visiting family, which we will likely do again in the future, but we will not be choosing to stay at this hotel.my husband and i stayed the past sunday, september 27, at the ellis hotel. the overall experience at the hotel was not bad; the room was nice and the bed was comfortable. however, the bathroom was very small and the lighting inside very low.my understanding when i booked the room was that the breakfast was included, but when we checked in, the receptionist said the cost was 15 usd if we wanted the buffet. for 15 usd, we had high expectations about the food, but the reality was completely different. they have a chef who cooks omelettes made to order, but they did not have anything else exceptional. the other options in the buffet were a handful of stale pastries (really stale and unedible), some bacon and biscuits and some oatmeal. nothing tasty - really mediocre food. we recommend to anybody who wants to visit atlanta to choose a different hotel that includes breakfast or just do not pay 15 usd for that terrible food. they do not have any complementary, the cost of a bottle of water is 2 usd.we stayed at ellis for 5 nights. staff are very friendly and nice. however we did not have house keeping service for three days!!! i had to ask the front dest for clean towels every day. that was not nice at all. beside that, good location, nice room, nice staff, valet parking was convenient.my husband and i were looking forward to our trip to explore atlanta and see a braves game. we saw the ellis online and from the photos we thought we got a great deal on a nice hotel! wrong. pulling up, we couldn't even get our car to the valet service (which costs an arm and a leg anyway) during the busy traffic and the street location. so we parked on our own still paying more anyway. we get there, and the front desk woman was very nice. we were hoping the hotel would be great from there on. nope. just more disappointment. we get in and the room we requested was easy access. after a confusing elevator ride which no one explains to you ahead of time you only go to your floor when you swipe a card, we realized our door was crammed in a small hallway off the elevator with 4 other rooms immediately next door. we knew right away we had a small and poor room. yup . this was the smallest hotel room i had ever stepped foot in. terrible! you can barely move ! it was extremely disappointing. the pillows had stains on them from previous stays. i ended up covering them in my own garments. only plus was the bed was super soft to lay on. the room was very disappointing, and valet service just the same. after going out to the game that night we came back around 10:30pm. now, after not being able to use their service before we hoped that the less busy time of day would mean we could use it. nope. they were closed for the night. and they don't have hours posted so we had no clue. overall, a sad trip. defiantly finding another hotel provider our next time around !where to start? you enter the postage stamp size lobby to blaring radio and one working elevator and a dirty, dingy everything. after the 10 minute wait for the elevator, the tiny, hostel sized room is also dirty and claustrophobic. it is challenging to even walk around the bed in the small space, and impossible to setup to work or lounge unless you sit on the bed. i thought there was no bathroom in my room, because the door had to be completely shut in order to see/open the closet or get around the bed. the bathroom didn't even have room for a tub - just a standing shower - and was also dirty - with strokes from a long ago mop apparent through the dust and dirt on the floor and mold on the shower walls. there are numerous lovely and comfortable hotels in the immediate area - do not suffer through this one just to save $20. never again for me, and i am in atlanta every couple of weeks.the property remains atop my list of intimate boutique properties in atl. my review may not be as glowing as it has been in the past as the overall experience wasn't as amazing as previous stays. however, it still ranks as a top 5 property in atl for me.great to see samson again - always atop of our transportation needs to the level of anticipating them - a rarity anymore. the front end team did a very good job, however not great and that's okay even if your expectations are higher than most - the gals could have been more on their game\" but not everyone has great days everyday. the f&b team again were on their game from great room service to the terrace being as fabulous as it always is/was - attentive, nearby, pleasant, happy, consistently high quality/quantity of food/drinks.the property is showing signs of wear - i've been coming here for 6 years as of 2015 - with this stay up on 15 the fresh air floor. the floor was very comfortable, the view over the entry (east - with views of stone mtn, gp and ritz-carlton) is not the most desirable with the noise below. i don't recall specifics regarding other views, however i remember carnegie/marriott courtyard (i think) was quieter. the specifics - the bed linens were picked/pilled and not as \"tight\" as i would have expected them to be. this impression was compounded by the fact that housekeeping missed cleaning the room entirely in our 2 night stay - very disappointing. now to their defense, we didin't leave our room until lunch time either - but being gone for 4 hours certainly left a disappointing feeling that in that time, on that floor, with our loyalty, they missed this point - a bit embarrassing. i was surprised there was no frig on this floor/room given the fact that i've always had one in a room and never had to request one. another point of anticipation that the team missed. the cleanliness of the room was meh, which was the other disappointing fact. there's a standard and upholding a standard is easy once the standard is set. sad commentary on the attitude of idgaf is what my perception was - sink, around toilet, shower tiles, shower doors were haphazardly given a \"once over\" in my opinion - definitely not up to standard. wifi sucked on the floor - barely could connect and limited connectivity consistently - was able to connect to ritz across the street with stronger signal that here.i love the property and always willing to stay here in relative competition to the other adjacent properties, but when in comparison to other boutique hotels in town, i just may have to consider the others - w, 12 centennial, artmore, indigo, etc. so, step it up back to the gem of atl that you've always been. even rock stars have bad days - don't make it another one.\"i don't know why that hotel is rated so good. the rooms are partly cleaned,e.g. the magazines which provide information about atlanta were covered with dust, the tv has a terrible picture quality, internet doesn't work and the cleaning lady didn't show up today. the furniture is old and scratched. the bed was comfortable and the stuff is really friendly, but that doesn't save the stay anyway. totally overpriced for the quality it provides. may be it should be rated as 2+ stars hotel.really let down the moment i opened the door to my room. at $329/night i assumed (foolish me) that the rood would be a lot nicer then all their propaganda stated. rug had large creases desk was chipped and had huge white coffee mug rings on it mattress was old and beyond it's replacement date. i wasnt looking for 5 stars at the location it was in but..... really? second rate all the way.we were greeted warmly by all of the staff, from the parking valet to valerie, the concierge who checked us in. we thought our room was a bit small, but not really a problem. we were given directions, with maps, when not sure of best way to get to places.the room was clean and made up for us early each day.the ellis is surrounded by restaurants shops, and, yes, a cvs, which was handy for a stop for some items. our room, on the 6th floor overlooked peachtree st. across from a marta station and also a streetcar stop. the street was noisy one night, possibly from a club on the next block.we will return to the ellis the next time we are in atlanta.i recently stayed at the ellis for 5 nights. i am baffled by the great reviews. here is my unbiased review. the 8th floor smelled very funky. the room was not as clean as it should have been (dust on the carpet behind the door and along the baseboards). on day three all i needed was towels. i left a tip and note thanking the housekeeper. when i returned the tip was gone, the note remained but no clean towels and the room was not straightened up as expected. when i inquired about the towels the housekeeper told me that she took the money because there have been thefts of tip money (hmmm...ok ....). the workout room was simply dirty, with dust on some of the equipment and nothing appeared to have been wiped down or refreshed in a while. the front desk staff was friendly depending on who you got that morning/evening. and yes the rooms are small. the lobby furniture and elevator could use a good cleaning. that's it.my friend and i made reservations for one night because we were in town seeing a concert. i have heard great things about the ellis and was excited to stay in this boutique hotel. it seemed like so many little things went wrong. i doubt it is like this for everyone's stay, however none of these issues should have occurred in the first place and no one did or said anything to make them better.first off, our reservation was not in the system. we had the conformation number on our phone and they could not find it whatsoever. the reservation was made for 2 double beds and since they didn't couldn't find our reservation they said that they would book us a room but they were out of double beds. luckily, we were flexible. we got a king room. our room was billed to us at a higher price than our conformation. we questioned it and it was fixed but only after we checked our credit card that evening. our room keys would not work initially. had to go back downstairs and get them reprogrammed. they wouldn't work the second time around and had to make another trip. the receptionist escorted us back to our room and got them to work. the doors are very old and using the key card was like trying to find a sweet spot with a traditional lock and key.my biggest problem with all of this was that it took us at about 45 minutes to an hour to get into our room. what if we needed to be somewhere? what if we had to have 2 double beds? my friend and i have both worked in the service industry and understand the computer glitches and hangups that happens and we remained patient. it wasn't going to ruin our night out. our receptionist was very helpful. she was extremely busy and alone at the desk on a friday night. the lobby was incredibly busy and there should have been a second person helping her.last but not least-the problem with breakfast. the room service menu stated that breakfast can be ordered between 6:30-11:00. there was a separate flyer for the terrace bistro stating that on saturdays and sundays a breakfast buffet was available from 6:30-11:30. we went downstairs right at 11 and was told that breakfast was over. needless to say, we were over it.the room was extremely lackluster. very small and cramped. no mini fridge or microwave. the shower and bathroom was very nice and featured higher amenities. the ice machine was also broken on our floor. bottled water in the room was also $2 a pop. needless to say, do yourself a favor and spend the extra $ and stay across the street at the ritz. the extra amenities are worth it hands down.the ellis is a boutique hotel, in walking distance from many downtown attractions. staff are helpful, hotel is safe, and clean. rooms a little small, but that is the age of the building. no complaints.this hotel is a very old hotel, and that comes with some inherent problems.pros: the staff was super nice, friendly, and helpful in every way possible. great attitudes, and personable.cons: though the hotel has been refurbished, the age of the hotel causes some problems. the rooms are much smaller than expected. we stayed in a conner room, and there was about as much space as a japanese micro-room. the external walls are not insulated well, so the cold came right through the walls and the old-style windows. the heater had to work extremely hard to keep the temperature reasonable, which meant it sounded like a jet engine was on all night. but worst of all, we could hear every single small noise that came from the city and street below--and we were on the 9th floor.overall, if i had to do it again, i would have stayed at the westin or other chain. i typically like independent hotels, but this one just didn't live up to my expectations of what i paid for the room.the hotel is well located. the staff is great. they really do what they can to accomode you.but it's not enough.it was the last two nights of a 24 days road trip so we wanted a nice hotel to rest. i don't mind to spend a little more to get a little more. the major problem in this hotel is the noisy ac. even when it's off and there's no stream anymore there is a noise. and not a small one. i slept with ear plugs ( which i hate to do by the way) and keep hearing it. we had to choose. hear a little bit less noise and freeze or warm up and set the ac on and end up deaf.the furniture is a worn. they charge for bottle water and the air in the room is dry.i know all those things is minor inconvenience but not at this rate.the day before we stayed in a hotel 70$ less per night and the room was in a better condition.i left the hotel with kind of a ripoff feeling...you should easily find a better hotel for the same rate.despite some concerns about unloading our stuff on the street (no drive-up covered entrance, just a busy downtown street with cars going right by cars), we decided to stay here and we had a good experience. the manager, kim, did everything to make our stay wonderful and made us feel very welcome. the room was nice, the restaurant was fantastic (tasty appetizers outside in the verandah, fine dinner and wine inside, and good buffet breakfast for only $14), and all the staff were very friendly (thanks, antionette). good location if you have downtown business. all downtown hotels have noise (early morning garbage trucks, etc.) and inconveniences (can't get to car, must relinquish car to valet, no options to be self-sufficient, etc.), but my only concern with ellis would be the drop-off situation, which was on a busy street with no separation from cars, so i felt hurried and accidentally grabbed the wrong bag, which was inconvenient to switch, so plan ahead for grabbing your bags quickly (no problem at all for airport guests with just a bag in a taxi trunk, of course). i would definitely stay here again if i had business downtown.my fianc√© and i were visiting atlanta for the first time and wanted to stay downtown in close proximity to everything. after reading the reviews on trip advisor and looking at the hotel site, we were very excited to find such a beautiful boutique hotel downtown for a great price.the friendly staff, the location and price were the only positives from the ellis hotel. my fianc√© and i both travel frequently for work and leisure and have stayed in many hotels throughout the country and internationally. this by far, was the worst hotel experience we both have encountered.when we arrived, the valet was very friendly and helped unload all of our bags onto the cart. there was really no other parking option besides valet so we were almost forced to use the $25 a night valet parking. we then preceded to check in for our two night stay. the rate that we booked for the two nights was not the amount that the ellis hotel had. luckily, we had the email confirmation showing the amount we booked the two nights for. the front desk receptionist then gave us the room rate we originally had. she wrote down the room number and gave us two room keys after taking both of our licenses and then returning to us. we went up the room she gave us only to find out that the keys she gave us did not work. my fianc√© went back downstairs to have this problem fixed. when he came back up with a technician we entered the room only to find out that it was already occupied. there were open suitcases and it was obvious this was not our room. thank goodness no one was in the room at the night as it was 11:00 p.m. when when we entered! it only gets worse from here‚ä¶‚ä¶the technician called down to the front desk to inform them that this was not our room and to find out where we were supposed to be. the woman at the front desk apologized and said we were supposed to be in 1006 not 1003. the technician then helped move our luggage to the correct room and used a master key to let us in the room. the room was average. nice bathroom and shower. however the ac was not working properly. the temperature was set at 72 but it was very stuffy, as though the air circulation was not good. we did have a nice corner room with a lot of windows and natural light.the next morning my fianc√© realized he stuck his license inside the initial set of room keys card holder. when we went to the front desk to retrieve the license, they informed us that the technician threw the keys away which also meant his license was thrown away too. we realized this was a mistake. however, had we not have been assigned an incorrect room this would have never happened. i spoke to one manager who told me she was sorry and offered to give us complimentary continental breakfast for the inconvenience\". of course, i declined this offer because we felt this was not good enough for the mistakes their staff had made in less than 24 hours of being at their hotel. we waited to speak with a different manager as this one was not trying to help us out.the final day of our stay, we got the bill under our door and noticed that the hotel charged us $204 for a aerus fresh air environment room which we did not have. the room rate should have been $159 for a king premium room. immediately my fianc√© went downstairs to the front desk to speak with the manager and dispute the room charges and the fact that his staff issued the wrong room and lost his license. after a good hour speaking with the manager about all of our issues we encountered, the manager gave us 50% off of our bill. the manager offered to comp us another night at the ellis hotel, but my fianc√© kindly told him we would never return to this hotel. this manager, tom, was very nice and helpful and he thanked my fianc√© for being calm throughout all of these problems.when i got home, i made sure to check my credit card activity to make sure the hotel charged us the correct amount. not surprised to find out that there were two charges that cleared (not pending) on my credit card statement for over $600 from the ellis hotel. i immediately called the hotel and they informed us that there was something wrong with their visa credit card machine and that they issued a credit two days ago. the lady i spoke with said to call my credit card company and they should be able to see the transaction. so i did just that and there was no credit issued by ellis hotel. needless to say, i disputed this with my credit card company and they removed the amount that was not supposed to be there. when i called the ellis hotel back, she said that the hotel issued this credit on 7/16 and an email was sent to us showing the confirmation of this credit. we never received an email on 7/16 from the ellis hotel. this was a lie because just as we hung up we received an email with the receipt dated 7/19 at 3:27 p.m. from the ellis hotel which means someone sent that over when i hung up the phone with them not when they initially said it was sent.two other issues we encountered (as well as many other guests) was the key cards not working in the elevator and spotty wifi. almost every time we went to use the key card in the elevator to get up to the room, it would not work and we had to get out and have the front desk reactivate the card. like i mentioned this happened with almost every guest we encountered in the lobby or in the elevator. very inconvenient to constantly have to go to the front desk to get the key to work just to get up to your room. every time we entered our hotel room, i had to reconnect to the wifi.overall, this was the worst hotel experience and i would never recommend this hotel to anyone staying in downtown atlanta. i truly hope that no one ever has a to experience what my fianc√© and i did at the ellis hotel.\"great location. the staff, with the exception of the restaurant and bar, were very pleasant. the bartender was grouchy.but, what really disappointed me was the condition of the room. it was dusty everywhere and the bathroom was not very clean. i complained to front desk who told me that it would be corrected, but it was not re-cleaned (i dusted all myself) and there was no follow-up to my complaint.the bed was very comfortable.the fitness center was even dirtier.the happy hour hors d'oeveres was a large tuna melt cut into squares.we picked the ellis hotel to stay away from your normal chains.. looking for a change... but after staying there i think we would have been better at a holiday in or hampton.. anyway we paid for the location.... the room was remodeled... to new style but the hotel is quiet dated the bed is very uncomfortable the breakfast buffet was not worth $14 a meal... except the fresh eggs cooked to order by the chef ...but here is what is good the location... although there is a bunch of hotels around to choose from next time... i do not think we would go back to the ellisdon't be deceived by nice pictures and friendly reviews, the staff themselves must be writing them, because there is no way this hotel honestly gets almost a 5 star rating. i picked this hotel hoping for an enjoyable comfortable get away with girlfriend and had far from it. from the moment we heaved open the front doors we were greeted with sneering employees waiting to take off with our time and money. we came in with only backpacks and the concierge literally took them off our backs when i could very well carry my own luggage, and save any tip, i asked for my things back and he grudgingly returned our items. immediately after check in we proceed to find our room. the ladies who checked us in didn't even tell us where our room was, i thought perhaps the elevators would disclose the location. after waiting several minutes for the elevators to arrive we popped in knowing no more than before we ascended. it took 2 tries and quite a lot amount of time until we found our room. finally, we got in, eager to see our view my girlfriend threw back the curtains to show a brick wall. a brick wall and a dark alley way with other persons windows looking into ours, was the scenic atlanta view, lovely. well let's unpack and wind down, hmmm a bit steamy in here is it? what's up with this a/c. i follow the directions, this is air, it isn't too hard to control, then why is it so hot? i call the downstairs to complain, they send someone up, a/c is broken. a rude nasty man takes an hour to finally get the airflow moving, the temperature goes down but my temper on this place doesn't. so maybe i didn't check room amenities but with the buck we were shelling out i expected a least a mini fridge and a dvd player, what do you do in here? a bath perhaps? no, the tub was tiny and had other peoples hair still glued to its walls. i regret booking the stay, wish i had my money and time back but that's not happening. the only thing i like here during the stay was my girlfriends company, but next time we'll just stay at home if these are the costs.we were very disappointed with our stay at the ellis this past weekend. we were in town for a concert, so we dropped our bags off as soon as we were able to check in. after the concert when we returned to the room we realized how dirty it was (if we had noticed earlier we would have asked for another room, but it was rather late by the time we got back we didn't want to deal with the hassle). someone's clothing was left on the floor in the closet, and the ice bucket was 3/4 filled with dirty water. the bed wasn't made properly and the duvet was on backwards. it wasn't unbearable, and i've definitely stayed in worse hotels, but we were expecting to feel like we splurged on a nice hotel downtown atlanta, not like we stayed at a travel lodge on the side of the interstate.the building is nice, cozy and in a great location. my problem is that i called 5 times trying to make a reservation. i was quoted one price by the first reservation person, and was never able to talk to her again...they said she worked first desk, then they said the price changed (in less than 10 mins) i decided to come in person and was told a price with an incidentals fee. i wanted two rms and it wasnt until i came for the actual rms that i was told that i would be chagred two incidental fees. i told her i was paying cash but my card was swipped and the 1 room n fee was charged to it..(inconvenience) i was told i would get the fee back when i checked out, but my husband brought it to her attention that it may take longer then she said, oh yes it could take up to 7 days... thats misleading... i got a letter under my door saying we had free bfast with our room... then i went forthe $1 a glass of wine, i ordered 2 glasses of rozay and was given the last of rozay n he said therewas no more so i had to get another kind (as if they were not prepared to serve their guests) later my husband called abt the wifi that wasnt working so i tld him to ask abt the bfast ( how to order it) and he told her abt the letter...she said the letter addressed to me, my name on the envelope and rm # on the outside was not meant for me...thennnn they called back and said someone was coming to get the letter...so the housekeeper came to get the letter by knocking twice loudly. i will never stay here again! they lost a would-be good guest!!!! i didnt enjoy any of this experience!!!!the service is unacceptable. the dates of the room were called in advance to be changed and we were told by the staff that the hotel would be able to accommodate us. once we arrived at check-in the staff told us that they could not accommodate us and there was nothing they could do. once we arrived to our room the water was extremely cloudy, the room was extremely small, not as big as advertised. the only bright side to this hotel is the bellman and valet. their service was amazing.i was looking for something a little special\" for a trip with my husband and exchange student. we were going to atlanta to show her the \"town\" and though the ellis is definately within walking distance to all the happening venues it was not what it advertised. upon entering the parking area we were greated...eventually ...and eventually someone took our luggage. the lobby was in dis-repair with bits of molding, messy walls and old carpet around the check in area. not what i expected from a \"botique hotel\" of its listing. we reserved a jr. suite so that our student guest would be in the same room with us and the hotel assured us that the sofa bed would be made up for us. it was not...ok..no problem...i will call down and they will correct their over site. their idea of correcting it was to bring up the linens and to proceed to argue with me over whose job it was to make up the bed. now this was suppose to be worthy of my paying top dollar for their \"personal care\". the room was not in top repair either with its coffee table looking like a rescue from a thrift store...worn furnishings and carpet. this along with other phu-pahs..created the feeling of..\"ok...won't be back here.\" even the teenager we had with us was aware of the sub-standards. the bed was comfortable and the bathroom sleek; but this was not enough to make up for the poor service. when dealing with the front desk i ended up having to ask for a manager who became very elusive. wish i could say it was just an off day...or we just happened to get a sub-standard room.....don't think so. atlanta...we will be back...ellis....not on a bet!\"my entire family stayed here recently for a long weekend. they normally stay at the westin but we heard so many good reviews, we thought a change would be good. not. it was very noisy, the a/c was poor and the front desk personnel were mostly incompetent. beautiful hotel, poorly managed.we stayed for only 1 night but the hotel, room and location were all excellent. we will stay here again when we return to atlanta. if there is any negative it would be the low pressure of the shower but in all fairness they have the rainfall shower heads.i recently stayed at the ellis and i was really disappointed. the room was very small and the only space that was available for standing was just below the end of the bed, which was arm length from the tv. the room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable but for the price paid, the marriott or the hampton inn ould have giving me a whole lot more the my money. the food was very expensive for what was ordered. i had grits, fruit, omelet and my significant other had grits, eggs and ham and we paid $47. i do think the staff was very nice and i was on the 5th floor so i heard toilets being flushed and showers going in the middle of the night. the layout of the hotel was not appealing because at the entrance, the only thing there was the front desk and the staff did not inform us of anything else they offered (for ex. a lounge or restaurant). so i would not be returning and i will not be referring anyone here.from reading the many reviews of this hotel i really thought this was going to be a great hotel, but in fact it's the exact opposite. it's a small old building with aging infrastructure, very loud (and consequently unusable) air conditioning, noisy plumbing and small rooms. the environs could also be better - i know it's not the fault of the hotel that the room has views of a decrepit empty lot, but...are there positives? service is reasonable. my car is delivered quickly, and problems are resolved. but by no stretch of the imagination is this a high quality hotel. won't be back.our first stay at the ellis was during the ice storm of 2011. all across atlanta, the stress was palpable. but not at the ellis. the staff was, basically, living in the hotel and we all rode it out together. the kitchen and bar(s) coped just fantastically with no deliveries and short-falls across the board. ironically, we are dyed-in-the-wool starwood customers and simply ended up at the ellis because the w was inaccessible (ice-bound).we have since spent several weeks at the ellis during the past year and i can assure all that we will never stay anywhere else in atlanta.did i mention the terrace restaurant? during the nine days of july, '012, that we stayed at the ellis, we never dined anywhere else. we are foodies from sonoma, ca, and never had any desire to dine elsewhere. in atlanta, that speaks volumes. no regrets.the staff is top-notch. contrary to one other late-arrival review i saw on this board, i have found the late-night staff to be exemplary. we fly first class and i always arrive a bit blurry. our most recent arrival at the ellis (1am) found me struggling with the sidewalk. calvin came out in the rain and said, mr. w (they remember your name at the ellis), may i give you some assistance?\"i would've kissed him, but my girlfriend intervened.keep in mind that the ellis is a re-fit insane asylum (with appropriate legend) so the rooms are kind of manhattan-sized. but the rooms are very well-appointed. mattresses, linens, pillows are right up there with any other.we recommend staying on higher floors so one does not have to experience manhattan-like street noise.did i mention the fact that there is a marta station directly across the street? also, the ritz-carlton is across the street and has a 24-hour taxi line.all of that being said, there is one downside regarding the ellis...when exiting your room in the morning, you will find a usa today at your doorstep.you have to go to the r/c to get a nyt or an ajc.\"this hotel is very small. misleading pics. the elevators are only big enough for you, your luggage, the bellhop & maybe one other person. the halways feel like mousetraps (height & width-wise). my room greeted me with the corner of the be as soon as i entered. it also looked kind of old. i was told during booking that every room had a view (i had a city view in mind), but what i got was a view of an abandoned brick building. the fitness room only has 2 treadmills & an elliptical. good parts...despite its lack of space, it does offer a free wine tasting every evening & they give you $15 off 1 meal at the restaurant; clean room; the staff is very helpful & really nice--good people. if you don't mind something very small & a $25/day valet, this may be for you, but i wouldn't stay there again.the so called deluxe king room was about the size of my home office. the tv only had a few hd channels and working the tv was a challenge for some reason..it was like the remote and the tv weren't communicating. the noise level was ridiculous...first of all you can hear everything from outside....and then the a/c was louder than the ones u find in a cheap motel...and the staff was not hospitable at all. the best thing this hotel has going is its cleanliness and the breakfast. why its been rated 4 star is beyond me.the hotel is awesome!!! the rooms are exceptional and the staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need. it is the best place to stay in atlanta!!my husband and i travel to atlanta every year for a meeting. we usually stay at the ritz carlton and love it. just for a change up, we decided to stay across the street at the ellis. what a mistake. the staff is somewhat apathetic and disinterested in making the customers in feeling welcome. we were put in a room that was so loud we couldn't sleep all night. not a problem at the ritz across the street. there was no bathtub, just a shower. the room was so small that the bed had to be pushed up against the wall. so i got to climb in and out of the bed from the foot.the next morning, we called to see if we could get a different room. they said fine, come down stairs and we will change your rooms. i hung up, and realized, wait a sec, why don't they send someone up here to help us move? so, i called again and they sent some up. she second night was a bit better. it was quiter and we were able to sleep. on the positive side, the beds are comfortable and the pillows nice. also, the rooms are clean.i had read reviews about the restaurant so we held out hope that it would redeem our hotel experience. it was a sunday night, around 8:00. we went to get a table and couldn't find anyone to seat us. so we walked up to the bar to get a drink and wait. they told us that they couldn't serve us at that bar, we had to go down stairs to get a drink. we still couldn't find anyone to seat us, so we decided to go get appitizers at another restaurant and come back later. we came back about an hour later, we were seated, ordered drinks and our meal. my husband got his beer, but my drink never came. we ate, we were told my drink was on it's way. after we finished eating. my drink came.we never felt the warmth and hospitality that we experience at the ritz across the street. the staff was apathetic at best, not helpfull at worst.we won't be back.we came into atlanta for a concert for one night and everything was great until we got our car from the valet and realized stuff had been stolen from inside our trunk, when we told the hotel about it, they pretty much just wanted to pass the buck to the valet, who they subcontracted, they said we had to fill out a report with the valet company, which we had to wait for a manager to come to the hotel who was across town and didnt know how long itd take him to get there, the hotel didnt offer anything in good faith\", they didnt even offer to comp the $23 parking fee...to say the least we were very dissapointed in how they handled it, whether or not the valet company is their own people, theyre a reflection on the hotel...we will not be going back\"my wife and i booked this hotel for our anniversary night. we've stayed in a good bit of hotel in atlanta and never stayed in the ellis so we thought we'd give it a shot. the room was alot smaller than thepictures look, which wasnt really a big deal. we started to get ready for dinner which we had reservations for as well as plans for the rest of the night, and there was no cold water in the room! maintenance came and looked at the faucet, then left for 30 min and only returned when i called to check up on the situation. after 30 more minutes they decide to move us to a different room. that room had no cold water either! i called the front desk to try and get another room and byron(front desk jerk) acted like i was bothering him. when i asked to understand the urgency because we had dinner reservations and 30 minutes to get ready and drive there, he got attitude and said he would call me back. never heard back from him. so, ended up taking scalding showers and was 30 minutes late for our dinner reservations. in my opinion, the twelve blows that place out of the water, and i will never stay there again.i have struggled about writing this information, but feel that it is important. in october i called to reserve a room for one night. it was for my daughter and her friends who would be arriving the same evening, without the card that was to pay all charges. i was required to send my credit card information and my drivers license by fax, with both sides of each card showing. i was reluctant to do so, but did it against my best instincts. the fraudent charges began showing up the next day. cell phones were purchased, payments to the state of alabama--- you nameit!! when i called the hotel to complain, i was told that new measures would be put in place so that confidential information would no longer arrive at a central fax location. i called the general manager, who was very nice about it and encouraged me to file a police report, which i did. i do hope that the hotel has indeed changed how it handles confidential information and i encourage anyone making a reservation to be wary.i was greatly disappointed in the quality and cleanliness of the rooms. my first room was on the 10th floor. after entering the room i noticed urine on my toilet. i called guest services and they were sending someone to clean it. as i waited i spotted lose change on the carpet next to the bed. i felt the room was barely cleaned before i arrived and instantly made me uncomfortable. they moved me to another room on the 3rd fl. a room i realized was a handicap room after entering. this room had a moldy smell. i noticed the shower curtain had water stains on the bottom. i had no choice but to take this room since it was late and i need to sleep. i slept with the lights on because i was that disgusted with the room never mind the noise that came from the large air-conditioning vents on the outside of the window. in the morning i called management to request a third room. that night- my last night there i finally had a decent room with nice city views. the draw backs from making it great was the mini fridge had a layer of dust over it and the bathrobe just as the other 2 rooms had pulls in the fabric- again making you realize you were about to use something used by many others. i travel a lot for work and i can‚äôt even remember feeling this way in the past. i choose a 4 star hotel for the service and for the simple feeling you are the first person to stay in an immaculately clean room. the managers were very nice and offered a free breakfast but this was not enough for me to ever return or to recommend the ellis hotel to anyone.my husband reserved this room based on the ellis website boasting it was luxurious and rated one of the top 5 hotels in atlanta. this turned out to be the opposite. walking in the hotel, the woman at the front desk greeted us in a less than hospitable manner. we were directed to wait\" with the others. carpet in the hallways and our room were filthy, littered with food crumbs, paper scraps, etc. i then used the restroom only to find used q-tips in the wastebasket. disgusting. the other wastebasket hadn't been emptied either. how could this possibly make someone think that the bed they would be sleeping in would be clean? another employee told us that they have been busy for the past five days and that a lot of their housekeeping staff have the day off or called in sick. i still paid for this room and i hate hearing excuses. if this hotel cannot provide the business they claim to offer, they should stop taking our money. the second woman cleaned our first room herself, yet when we returned to the hotel, we were told by the less than friendly woman at the front desk that they had moved us to another room but to wait because she was helping another customer. so we waited. going up to our original room to get our stuff, the second woman who cleaned our room told us we could go in that room. our keys had been de-activated. we were then told we would be moving to a different room. i guess they thought they made everything right when they offered us a 15% discount on dinner at the hotel. would you really eat at a hotel that can't even keep their rooms clean? we are headed to the ritz!\"i spent a week in this hotel. here are some of the things that you should be aware of:1. there is no car-parking in the hotel. you will have to park in one of the adjacent parking garages, so that's an extra $15 per day (at least)2. the room space is a bit cramped, it is not as big as the pictures on the hotel website make it look.3. response from the staff is quite slow. took them 2 hours to come in and fix a stuck thermostat.4. the shower heating is hit or miss. you will have to put up with lukewarm water if you need a quick shower. it also takes 5 minutes for the water to stop draining after the shower is turned off.i would recommend the marriott or the hyatt around the corner. it is a little bit extra but well worth the price.my husband and stayed one night for valentine's day weekend. the front desk staff acted as if we where bothering them. we shopped around and everytime we came up to the hotel the valet would be nowhere to be seen, even when we left the front desk could not find them. the hall ways are extremly narrow and the rooms are way!! too close together, also you could here everything going on in the hall way and the conversations in the room next to you. the business center had broken pens and hardly any paper.the area is also very creepy alot of homeless people and others hanging out at the wee hours of the night.stayed in many hotels and this one is in my bottom 3.i am usually not the type of person to write a review but honestly spend the extra 10-20 bucks and stay at a decent place.my friends and i stayed at the ellis on 12-31-09. upon arrival at thehotel we were all very impressed. the doorman/valet immediatelygreeted us. the check-in process was quick and everyone was veryfriendly. after helping us to our rooms, we went to the bar area.again, everyone was very helpful and the atmosphere was great. we leftthe hotel for a few hours and upon returning we went to the lounge toeat. we ordered two of the new year's eve specials. we had a total of4 different servers and it took over 45 minutes to get our food. wenever had any explanation of the wait and we were the only ones in thelounge. since this was the advertised special, it would seem likethere would have been plenty made in advance. also, we had to send asprite back because the glass was dirty and there was stuff floatingin it. the next morning when we got up to shower, there was no hotwater. after speaking with our friends in another room, we realized itwasn't just our room. we called the desk and they took our roomnumber. no one ever came to our room or called back. since check-outtime was approaching we washed in cold water in the sink. our friendshad someone come to their room and he checked the water temperature.again, no explanations were made. another call was made to the frontdesk where we were told that they were waiting on management. at thistime, the front desk worker told our friend that maybe he should tryto fix it if he could do better\". while waiting on the elevator wetalked to several people who had the same experience and several whoalso said they didn't have heat in their room. a worker who was alsowaiting on the elevator overheard our conversation and said that theyhad told the management that they didn't have hot water in the kitchenfor many days and was told it was just a kitchen problem. this mayexplain the dirty glass. upon check-out we were offered nothing andwished a happy new year. overall this hotel is beautiful and hasextremely hospitable people working in it. if the hot water problemhad been a new issue and had been addressed instead of acting likenothing was wrong, it would be understandable. we all got the feelinglike it was an on-going problem and to just get us all out of the wayas quickly as possible. for a hotel of this rating, i expected betterservice.\"the ellis move our entire group block to a completely different hotel on the other side of town without so much as a peep, had one of our party not noticed the charge from another hotel on their card we wouldn't have known until we got there. the hotel interior is nice, but they clearly don't care about accommodating their guests, and that's really what the hotel is supposed to be doing isn't it?this was the first trip and first impression of atlanta and it was disappointing. the lobby was absolutely beautiful and elegant so we had high expectations of our room and when we got to it we were mistakenly disappointed. the so called suit\" was not vacuumed, there was no microwave, nor did the air conditioner work well at all. our view out the window was a brick wall. the desk staff was undermanned and hard to check-in, but they were very professional about what they had to do. they did not know too much about the local area and that was frustrating as well. there are many other choices right around the same area that were in much better condition and were more pleasant. avoid this one if possible.\"i must say that i chose this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews. i typically prefer the westin, marriott, embassy suites, hiltons, etc. but i thought i would give this boutique hotel a chance. i reserved two adjoining rooms for four nights because they only offered jr. suites and there were three of us (me, my husband and teen son). don‚äôt waste your time, these rooms are so small that it didn‚äôt make a difference we were still sitting on top of one another and walking into one another.well, i learned quickly that the southern hospitality\" facade is only extended until you say \"no thank you\". we were told when we made the reservations about the parking garage behind the hotel so considering we had driven 11 hours and it was our first visit (we didn't know the hotel nor the area) we immediately parked there and walked the 1/2 block up to the hotel with our luggage... the doorman almost attacked us as we approached the door to grab our luggage and we said \"no thank you\" and we proceeded to walk in because we were right in front of the door. considering the fact that this is such a small hotel that when you step into the lobby the front desk is right there and when you step off the elevator to your floor, your room is right there, this service is really not needed (how about a pool and room service), but even if it was larger we said no thank you... he went further to sarcastically say \"and you didn't valet\" as if we were too cheap. immediately we were \"put off\" because he followed us into the lobby and kept prancing around the little lobby as if he couldn't wait for us to get on the elevator to discuss us with the two other employees working the lobby (the icebox at the front desk and the part- time concierge).on a better note ‚äì our best experiences were with those that were not natives to the south: william, (front desk), laemlak (valet) and troy (bellman). we were very fortunate to encounter these gentlemen and thank goodness they worked the shifts where we were either coming or going. william was full of hospitality and just genuinely warm, laemlak parked or retrieved our suv once we were advised on the valet service and was very personable and helpful with directions and informative on atl happenings and troy was just always available for whatever you needed, directions, advice on atl, insights on where to go, where to eat, etc. troy graciously tried to divert me to the individual responsible for advice (concierge) as if he might get in trouble for going above and beyond his job or offering the wrong advice, but i assured him that i wanted advice based on his atl experience and that there was no need to track her down for something as simple as a restaurant recommendation. concierge was rarely in the lobby.last but not least:housekeeping - we left a tip for housekeeping with the hopes that she would do a good job‚ä¶ not! if she put her cell phone down long enough she probably could have cleaned the room properly. it wasn‚äôt enough that i left the card out indicating that she didn‚äôt have to change the sheets, to help them stay ‚äúgreen‚äù. she half cleaned one room and skipped my adjoining room all together, so i had to call. her excuse was the door was locked‚ä¶ ‚äúhello‚äù they were adjoining suites where we had the interior doors propped wide open. second, management should tell her that if you reserve two rooms for four nights, you are entitled to soap/shower gel each night. one shower gel per room doesn‚äôt last four days; especially not the quality of shower gel provided. by the 3rd night i put up the do not disturb sign, i didn‚äôt even want her in the room until i was gone, it was just a waste of time.room service: do they offer it or not? i had to call to ask for a menu because there are no menus in the rooms.hvac ‚äì loud, loud and loud and it‚äôs either on or off because auto does not work or it‚äôs not properly calibrated (did i already say that the blower was ridiculously loud) and there are no fans/vents in the restrooms.internet ‚äì it worked an hour only on the first day‚ä¶. don‚äôt advertise free wireless high speed internet if it doesn‚äôt work. i called the 800# and the front desk and they blamed each other for the problem and as of my last day it still did not worklocation ‚äì seedy‚ä¶.oh my, homeless people are standing around peddling and street lighting is poor. there was no way that we were going to walk the ¬ω block from the parking garage at night, regardless of the price of valet because the ellis is not in a great location. the ritz carlton is directly across the street, leading one to believe that it‚äôs ‚äúprobably‚äù a nice area, well the ritz appears a little ‚äúshabby‚äù too so don‚äôt be fooled. stay closer to the higher end (1000 to 1600) peachtree and off the lower end if you can.if you have to offer ear plugs, it's the first clue that there's a problem indoors with the noisy staff in the hall or the traffic/peddlers right outside the hotel.my favorite: they charged me twice for both rooms‚ä¶.. mgmt was immediately available when i called and said that it should be corrected within 24 hours‚ä¶.. we‚äôll see.\"i stayed at the ellis hotel during a trip to see the color purple at the fox theatre. the staff was friendly and very polite. the food at the ellis grille at the hotel was good. i really loved their chocolate chip pancakes.i liked the decor of this hotel. we had a junior suite. i liked the way the room was layed out. the beds were great, very comfortable. the sofa was comfortable. i loved the flat screen tv.however, i have one major complaint - the bathroom. when i washed my hands i noticed that there was hair on the towels. i called housekeeping, and they very promptly brought some fresh towels. later, i noticed that there was hair in the bathtub. this is absolutely ridiculous.this is a nice hotel. it is a shame that their lazy housekeepers are making this hotel look bad.during our sightseeing trip in atlanta, we stayed at the ellis hotel on peach tree st for one night. we chose this place because it was within easy walking distance (apx 10-15min) to all the main tourist attractions in downtown atlanta and right across from a marta station. the hotel itself left us with mixed reactions:the good: the staff were friendly and the valet was pretty easy going regarding how long you could leave your car valeted before you were charged another day ($20 a day). the hotel itself was well decorated, the room had stylish furniture and beautiful fixtures in the bathroom. the bed was comfortable and the tv was good quality. we also had a nice time at night just sitting outside on the second floor lounge/restaurant without being hasseled. the location on peach tree st gave felt very safe and gave us easy access to restaurants at night, but you might want to avoid the block behind the hotel at night. the lobby was small but nice and for additional security you could not operate the elevator without a room key card.the bad: the room we had was ridiculously small. i instantly felt ripped off; if i hadn't received a 10% discount on hotels.com, i would have been very mad. having just stayed in a normal\" sized hotel room in athens, ga the night before, the ellis felt like a sardine can. trust me, the nice kohler fixtures did not make up for this. secondly, i could not get over the fact that there was no refrigerator whatsoever in the room. this ruled out a doggie bag at dinner and having cold drinks for the car ride home. also, while there was a closet, there was no dresser in the room and the bathroom, while nice, was also very small and had no ventiliation fan for the steam. the hvac was very loud and took more than a minute to figure out how to adjust. lastly, there was a giant airduct over our bed with an access panel that seemed like it would open up at night while we were sleeping.also, be aware that the hotel is on a corner next to a one way street which could make getting to the valet stand a little difficult. there are only about two spots reserved for you outside the hotel, so you might have to find some place creative to wait while the space clears up.lastly, be aware that at the time of our trip, cab faire for two people to go from the ellis to the aquarium/world of coke area [only a few blocks away] is a minimum $12 due to downtown flat rates and fuel surcharges. we made this mistake because we arrived late in the day and wanted to go to world of coke before it closed.while not horrible, i would not stay here again.\"my friend took me to the ellis for a surprise birthday stay. she'd booked the aquarium package. when we checked in we went back and forth with the front desk because they didn't show the aquarium package in the computer. we produced the confirmation and it was just ridiculous. they were almost arguing with us while we had the confirmation right there. then they said we couldn't go to the aquarium that day, it would have to be the following day. yada yada yada... they were hustling back and forth to the manager (whom we never saw) like a used car salesman. anyway, finally, they produced the tickets and we were off, of course with incorrect directions given by them and we walked about 6 blocks out of the way. the room smelled like bug spray but the beds were very comfy, the bathroom was really beautiful. rooms were pretty small and the windows smaller, so no real view. but i have stayed at the ritz across the street and the rooms weren't as nice as these really. they did have an hour manager's reception with free drinks and appetizers and the staff there were great. breakfast the next morning in restaurant was good- especially since it was included in our package. :) i have to say that the aquarium package was a really good deal with those tickets, hour reception, breakfast for two and 2 more free drink tickets. but, overall, i don't think i'd go back to this hotel. there are too many others in atlanta that are fantastic and want your business.i travel frequently for business, and i have stayed at hotels across the price range so i know what is reasonable and not. i was at the ellis for four nights and 5 days. my stay at the ellis was pretty bad, and here's why: upon entering my room, i found hair in the tub, sink, and toilet. later, i found more hair on the sheets. the breakfast order card (for ordering in-room dining to be delivered the next day) only appeared in my room on one day - once i used it, it was never replaced. i ordered breakfast, and it never came. the manager said he would call to recify, never did. i had to call him again -- after - get this - breakfast comes the next morning, waking me up. he never explained why that happened. i had to call his boss to try to get some satisfaction. the iron and ironing board was always left out. on the three days that the sheets were not changed, the bedding was just yanked up to the pillows (not made\"). the minibar was not restocked once. a coffee spill was left untouched on the desk, and i think the one day the cups were not clean (just wiped out). and worst, worst, worst of all: every day my key had to be recoded. on one afternoon, i had to get it recoded 4 times while the front desk staff just did it over and over again - not investigating, not apologizing. and the elevator takes forever. i did speak with multiple managers several times who had lots of apologies. though they took no steps to rectify the housekeeping problems, they credited me with two nights' stay for my breakfast troubles. while this is a significant attempt to make it right, which i appreciated, it still added up to a heck of a lot of tolerating bad service and consistent irritation to stay here. if i hadn't bought the trip on travelocity, i would have left on day 2. taken all together, who needs this kind of hassle? there are lots of other hotels within walking distance of this one - i would never return here. hilton atlanta seems nice, but have not stayed there...yet.\"in a city full of hotels, design and service is what one needs to stand out from the rest. the historic winecoff hotel built in 1913 was the sight of the deadliest hotel fire in 1946. a 28 million dollar restoration of the structure produced a beautiful modern design that i'm sure the original builders would be proud of. design of this boutique style hotel does indeed stand out from others in the area. however, the unprofessional, inattentive, and lazy service of this establishment will bring the vacancy this building has known during the past 61 years. their website boasts of having legendary, innovative and friendly, professional service.\" upon arriving for check in at the hotel the valet was no where to be found. upon entering the hotel lobby, there was a female sitting behind the front desk, obviously to busy daydreaming to stand up and greet me. i very politely let her know i was there to check in and saw that her name tag said \"concierge supervisor. \" she couldn't get my registration printed and had to call somebody to rectify it, once the paper jam was removed about 5 minutes later she could continue. i went to my room which i had been checked in to and it had not yet been turned over by housekeeping from the last guests who had stayed. upon going back down to the lobby and letting the supervisor know of the issue, she responded with \"oh, i was afraid of that. we've had some people call in sick today.\" while looking for another room a lady came in to inquire the whereabouts of the missing valet and asked if she needed to move her car that she self parked on the street. the supervisor responded, \"ah, na, you straight. the valet should be back soon.\" ( you would never hear such verbiage across the street at the ritz). upon returning downstairs later that evening to ask about something, a male employee was sitting behind the desk to lazy to get up and greet me. this level of service continued til check out the next morning. the valet took a very long time to retrieve my car since he didn't have a ticket for me (remember the valet was m.i.a. when i checked in so i had to leave my keys with the front desk.) on a more positive note, the rooms are well appointed with fine finishes such as espresso bamboo paneling, ostrich leather headboards, white limestone baths, black granite counter tops, kohler rain shower heads , 32\" lcd, ipod docking stations, honor bars, and my personal favorite ermenegildo zegna bath products. hopefully, gm thomas o'leary, will actually train his staff on customer service, perhaps send them across the street to ritz-carlton university!\"i stayed at the ellis on peachtree while at a conference in atlanta. the hotel room was great- comfortable, well appointed room with a nice robe and lots of pillows of varying softness. the staff was also quick to correct the lack of caffeinated coffee in our room. overall, a very nice experience with ethernet access in all the rooms. the hotel is still shaking out the kinks since opening in october, but the staff is very quick to correct any oversights, no matter how slight.this was a 15 minute walk to the world congress center, aquarium, world of coca-cola, and stadiums. it was a block from the hard rock cafe and several other restaurants.the restaurant inside was decent, and the menu was short but had a decent variety on it. we had the brunch on our last day, and the goat cheese and spinach omelets were incredible!i've stayed in many w hotels across the world and they have been exceptional. the dowtown one has a bit of catching up to do. on this occasion is was there for 8 nights so not going to be the cheapest of stays nevertheless you expect top service for a top price. every where you turn there are staff but not too many who are actually interested in helping. some on their mobile phones some chatting amongst themselves when they do engage it then takes several minutes for them to actually help. breakfast service in the restaurant was a joke. again lots of staff milling about but none that actually help or take an order. the mornings that i went there it took more than 45mins to receive my order of a simple continental breakfast and you have to proactively request a coffee top up. my room was ok, and the clean up service was adequate as i'm not sure they have been taught how to actually make a bed or clean a bathroom. gym facilities are ok but no sauna or steam room which is what i would expect at an establishment of this price. all in all its an ok place but but nowhere near the standard of the other w hotels i've stayed at. would i stay there again no.this is a great property - sleek, polished and ritzy. we had one of the corner rooms on the 12th floor, which was very nice. on checking in, we noticed some noise coming from the room above, which soon escalated to full-on banging, crashing and thumping. it was clear that construction was taking place above us. we complained and the noise stopped, but i‚äôm astounded that staff would be clueless enough to put us in this room, under these circumstances. did they think we might not notice? did they seriously think that guests who are paying more than $400 a night, won‚äôt mind loud construction noise directly above their room? the second major issue for me, is the $14.95 per day charge for high-speed wi-fi. this is an outdated, insidious practice. when staying in a hotel that purports to be this slick, i don‚äôt expect money-grabbing, chiseling policies like this. obviously, this is company policy and not the fault of the staff, but w hotels need to realize that when you‚äôre trying to build a brand that has style and panache, nickel & diming the guests for wi-fi is cheap, tacky and vulgar.i am writing this as an spg gold member. this is definitely not up to spg standards. my room is horribly tattered - everything needs to be replaced. the first day i was missing shampoo, conditioner, soap, coffee mugs. today i went for the room service menu and it wasn‚äôt there so i asked to have one delivered along with coffee mugs. it‚äôs been 45 minutes and still nothing! guess i shouldn‚äôt eat here. the phone when plugged in keeps ringing the room so i had to unplug it. i called last night from my cell phone and asked them to fix it today and still nothing. asked them again when i went downstairs (because no working phone) to ask for mugs and a menu still nothing.give it two stars because great view and someone who helped me this morning with directions was amazing. wouldn‚äôt go back - would actually change hotels if i weren‚äôt just here one more night.wanted to give a shot out to machae and aniya. with the system integration somehow my spg status got dropped from my reservation but aniya was able to added it and assist me to my room after machae was able to find an upgrade. machae also followed through to assist me in replacing a couple of lost items. i travel to atlanta often and will continue to visit this hotel.it‚äôs a w so it‚äôs sold as a younger person‚äôs scene. not a family hotel. so you‚äôd think they would‚äôve put more thought into their pool, a main reason why my group and i booked there. it‚äôs small, dirty and suffers from a fatal design flaw - it‚äôs built under an overhang so you will not get much sun. i counted 3-4 bandaids and more hair and stray weave that should be allowed in any public pool. i needed to tell the (polite but novice) servers at the top bar how to make a dark and stormy. the older security guard at the pool was downright rude and harassed my group.to be fair, other staff members were great. front desk crew was great and a guard on our last night poolside was much nicer. it‚äôs a shame to have such mixed staff experiences as it muddies the overall impression.my shower on the 11th floor never got hot. i switched rooms and that problem was solved. a drink ticket was offered for the trouble. breakfast food took forever in the restaurant and wasn‚äôt worth it. late night cheeseburger however somehow was pretty good.so while some staff tried hard, there were just too many flaws to convince me to come back to this particular location. maybe it was an off weekend for them, but hard to overlook all the issues.not a bad hotel but this hotel did not feel cleanand it definitely should not charge what it doesthere was no mattress cover on the bed and that grossed me out from the beginning.the all you can eat buffet is a joke .the scrambled eggs were rubbery , the fruit was not ripe and the service sucked !the best part of the hotel was the insight driver alonso ,he was knowledgeable and friendly .i was staying at the hotel for a conference, also at the hotel. i asked for a late check-out so that i could change out of my business clothes after the conference, around 12:30. i was told the hotel was too full to accommodate this request. i checked out in the morning, went to the conference, and later asked at the front desk if i could change in the locker room of the gym/spa. a very helpful person at the front desk instead offered my original room, as it hadn't yet been cleaned by housekeeping. so, after packing my bags and having checked them during the conference, the individual escorted me back to my room where i unpacked my bags, changed, repacked them, and rechecked them. this could have been avoided! i was also placed in a room with two double beds instead of a king, and was told there were no king rooms available. the room was very dark, many electrical sockets didn't work (including the one the main floor lamp was plugged into), and the glossy paint on the walls in the bathroom had condensation stains running down them. there was also a large stain on the carpet. the windows overlooked the hvac system of the building next door, which sounded like a truck idling, even with the windows closed.my friends and i stayed here during our vacation. i am only giving two stars because there was trouble from day one. upon arrival we had to deal with the back and forth about prepaying for our valet parking between the front desk and the valet manager. the person who checked us in gave told us we would be charged one amount only to find out that she guessed\" the amount of the charge for incidentals. we passed a few housekeeping staff on our way to our room. we asked one woman to take our picture and she shook her head and her index finger at us. there was a photo area in the lobby in which we could take pictures and email them to yourself. this would‚äôve been great except your email cannot have any numbers in it (which mine does).the next day housekeeping only made our beds and emptied the trash cans. they left the glasses from the hotel bar in the room and did not refill the tissue. the toilet stopped flushing and after maintenance came to fix it you could hear the water glugging down the sink when you flushed the toilet. we asked for extra blankets that were taken and not replaced. the hotel atm did not dispense any cash yet debited the account and didn't give a receipt. when the front desk was notified they informed us that this has happened before (why do you still have that type of atm if it's faulty). that room was definitely not worth however much they were asking. not at all.\"unfortunately i would not recommend staying at the w atlanta downtown. i decor is interesting and the whole hotel seems to need a refresh, it is like the decor is trying to be edgy and trendy but it feels cold and dated. my shower was completely blocked for two days, but they cleared that pretty quickly. the staff were all lovely and friendly but i wont be staying there again. thank younot the worst hotel we have stayed at but left us wanting so much more. wanted but did not get:- a greeting at check in, to feel like we were welcomed- a room with some color or warmth- a room with decent lighting- a shower with water pressure, a door, some privacy- a sink that was functional- a bar that was stocked with the beer and cocktails on the menu- bartenders who were engaging- accurate food order- delicious food- concierge who was knowledgeable about the areawe aren‚äôt super picky travelers and tend to be fairly forgiving so if a few of the above had missed the mark, it wouldn‚äôt have been a big deal.(we did have a comfortable bed and our room was clean.)disappointed...i don‚äôt think any of the staff here cares about the guest experience and i did not like the room decor or layout.first, i should say the the staff was quite friendly and welcoming, and the valet folks got my car quickly every time it was needed. in addition, the architecture is pretty good, and the room i stayed in was good sized. i requested a king, but all they had available was a room with two queens. i would hope that lifetime gold status gets ya something, but i think that is a relatively minor inconvenience.other than that though...well, the place really needs a sprucing up, there were stains on the wall in the bathroom, the bathroom door didn't quite close the toilet area off, the carpet was frayed, the armoire was chipped and beaten up, and the desk had seen better days. i expect a lot more from a w. the property doesn't seem that old, but it seems like its seen hard times...sorta like the young actor or musician who parties way too hard and looks like crap before they're 30.finally, i had a packaged shipped.with materials for work. according to fedex, the package was signed for just after 10 on thursday, but i was never notified that it arrived. when i called friday morning looking for it, i was told yeah, it's been here--i was wondering if you'd call for it.\" wow. that kinda left me speechless.\"i just opened a restaurant june 1 so this was our first night to get away. we booked a night on points (12,000 to be exact) to try and have a relaxing saturday night out as date night.we arrived at 11pm and the valet parking lot was slammed and we had to wait quite a while for a valet to even come over. masses of people were outside and there was crazy loud music coming from inside the hotel.apparently the bar turns into a club on fri and sat nights until 2 am with a live dj. really wish this was posted online before booking because i would have stayed elsewhere.room was decent, but basically a throw back to the 70's and 80's. i also woke up with bug bites all over my legs so that's fun.neighbors were blasting loud rap music all morning and we couldn't get out quick enough.morning of checkout we called valet to have the car pulled around and they said they weren't accepting call-downs and you just have to go down with your ticket and wait. that completely defeats the purpose of valet. not worth the $38 for valet.not happy at all with the visit and most definitely won't be coming back here.unfortunately, paper-thin walls. i wouldn't recommend this place for anyone wanting a good nights sleep. nice restaurant and staff though. and the location is excellent. but what good is all that if you can't sleep? you're better off at the hilton or marriott.left a review and it got deleted so ima try this again. i stayed at the w for my birthday weekend (feb. 24th) when i checked in to the hotel everything seemed great till i got to the room. first thing ordered wine to be in room upon arrival that clearly had not even been chilled it was room temp. second i had a broken lamp in my room not broken but destroyed. i arrived late on my birthday night from savannah, ga about 10:00p. me and my lady got dressed went straight out came back hit the bed, when i woke up i realized we had slept on a dirty bed. i went down to desk and spoke with the manager he gave me $100 credit, cool but not cool. i returned to room woke my lady and realized she slept in a blood smear, now we have a bigger problem. so we returned to front desk and he comped our first night never asked would we like to switch rooms or offer us a upgrade to mind you this is no regular stay it's a birthday stay. we was cool trying to just make the best of our weekend. we still had a few more problems with the hotel and they ended up comping our whole stay. the night manager pete carver cut me off at the bar after a few sips of one drink still deciding to spend money with the establishment and made the wrong decision still ended having to call corporate. this hotel surprised me on the service giving being my first time ever staying at a w i would rather stay at a quality inn.upon check in, the clerk was short and rude. she was not greeting at all. asked me for id and credit card, and kept it moving.the night was suppose to be a birthday slumber party for my sister. it all stared off pretty good, until we got a knock on the door from the security guard telling us due to noise complaints, and extra guest, you have 15 minutes to vacate the room\". they gave us no warning about our noise levels, nor did they tell me upon check out that we were only to entertain guest in the \"living room\".we ended up leaving. it took 45 minutes for valet to retrieve our vehicles. i would never stay or recommend this hotel to anyone.they are extremely strict on their policies regardless if you were informed or not.\"i've stayed at this property a few years ago so i thought it would be just as nice. i believe it was in 2014 and i don't remember paying that much for the room but i thought i would get great service to match the price. first, the valet is horrible. there was always traffic right at the w entrance b/c the valet was backed up. for parking being $32 a night and tip not included, it better be on point.also, the drink club was unavailable friday night due to a private party and just wasn't open on saturday. signage for that private party would have been great. i called to see if the drink club was open and they failed to tell me this. we got all dressed up to party in their club, walked up the staircase only to be shooed away. dancing in a well lit living room\" was not the same as the club. that was one of the reasons i wanted to stay at the w b/c instead of leaving our hotel, we could party there and just head upstairs at the end of the night. so we decided to go out for dinner. it was at that time we needed to use the wifi to download an app but because we are not gold and silver spg members, it cost $10! i was awe! after mulling over it all night, i decided to complain to the front desk and she gave us one day of wifi for free. why not include the basic package for regular spg members?!?!? why make us pay or complain to get wifi in 2016?!?!? everything costs! there's basically no complimentary anything. oh wait, they do have great fruit infused water by the elevator. the snacks are way overpriced, smart water is $10. you're better off going to walmart for snacks.the tv was horrible. you have to be sitting on the edge of the bed for the signal to work when you change channels. channel 38 was so soft on the volume that you couldn't eat and hear tv at the same time. the engineer said its the providers fault. for $170, i should have been able to lay comfortably in my bed and eat if i want and still hear the movie i want to watch. basically, you're better off choosing another 4-5 star hotel that has more complimentary things or gives you a great value for the price you pay. i will never visit the w again and i've already talked my parents out of their plans to stay there this june for their anniversary.\"stayed here for one night while passing through. my first time staying at a w brand. it's very upscale with great attention to detail. i did not have a reservation but was able to get a room with no problem. i checked in at night and the lobby is very dark as well as the room, not a big deal just putting it out there. i got the fabulous suite\". which was different to say the least , the shower is all glass and is between the sink area and the bed, which can be fun and you can watch tv and look over the sky line while showering! bed was comfy, no complaints with the room. had a few beers at the bar and only thing i didn't like was there was no one tv in the bar area, oh and it's like $38 dollars to valet here.\"having stayed previously in the w in buckhead, which was a very good experience, i was looking forward to this visit. unfortunately, my experience reflected the fact that the same chain (w) does not mean an equivalent experience. the experience at the checkout desk was pleasant (thanks, michael), but it would have been helpful to know that you had to use your card to get to use the elevator to get to our room (you were not supposed to have to use your card to go down, but often the elevator service required that too). two of our party got stuck in the elevator after trying their cards. this property is idea for clients who are either photosensitive or into vampirism. the lighting is very low level both in the hotel and in the rooms (many lamps no even distribution of light throughout the room). while trying to achieve a modern aesthetic the rooms were outdated, with one bedside drawer that was off its guides and a non-working bedside phone. during my three night stay the television remote disappeared from my room. to the hotels credit engineering resolve the phone and tv remote problem quickly, et voila the next day i had two tv remotes when i returned from my business meeting. someone also needs to clean behind the beds, where there was much dust. i know this because when my allergies kick in that's one of the causes, so i look. the btk restaurant was on one occasion excellent and a second visit subpar. the rooftop restaurant was closed throughout my stay, with no explanation offered. so guests were directed to the downstairs lounge where the service was terrible. after waiting 15 minutes to get table service for just a drink, i approached the bar to inquiry about what the issue was. i was told i we would have a server shortly. trying to present the hipster trait of aloofness in service more typical of the service typified at some higher end department stores, i got a distinct feeling of dismissiveness. that said, 5 minutes later a waiter walked right past our table signaling with a raise of this arm that he would be right back. after another 5-10 minutes he finally returned and we got our drinks 5-10 minutes after that. he couldn't have seemed to care less. in summary, not a good stay and i would not recommend staying here nor will i stay at this property again unless some major improvements in the hotel and staff training occur.the w hotel in downtown atlanta is a visually appealing property. it has a nice bar area, which is great for hanging out with friends for a drink. the rooms are very modern, sleek and fairly spacious. it really is a great looking hotel. and if i can help it, i will never stay here again.of all w's i have stay at around the country this one, by far, is consistently the worst experience i've ever had. the lack of training and professionalism from the people who work at this hotel never ceases to amaze me. anyone who travels often knows that your experience is largely shaped by the hotel staff. you can have a beautiful property essentially ruined by rude, pretentious, unknowledgeable, inattentive, unaccommodating staff. and this particular w has been this way for years now. they need to overhaul and hire people who understand guest services basic, common courtesy.you're first greeted by valet, if they happen to be at the door when you arrive. but good luck with that. then there is the always semi confrontational, least hospitable, job hating person you can imagine waiting to check you in. don't be surprised if this process takes much longer than normal as the person will likely have no idea what they're doing. and if they do, you'll never know it. enjoy the snail pace as several conversations are likely to be had amongst employees that have nothing to do with you or your stay...or the hotel at all for that matter. except for the fact that they're keeping you from getting into your room and bed after your long flight. i'd much rather hit up the holiday inn express as long as they know how to say good morning\" and \"welcome\". and at least pretend they're happy to have guests and not just distractions from their retelling of last night's club sagas. and since your stay is ruined before you reach the elevators, i don't need to get into the obnoxious level of noise and well into the morning party taking place in various rooms. but, if you happen to escape the check in unscathed, that 3am bass knocking on your walls will do the trick. don't worry, just dial the concierge and they'll.....\"this hotel is like a runway fashion show - beautiful to look at but completely impractical.first, the lighting is fit only for someone who wakes up looking immaculate or who has no need to actually see themselves in a mirror, like brad pitt in interview with a vampire.\" my husband and i stayed four nights at the w during a convention. i had to do my hair and makeup every morning at the convention center, because the lighting in our room was so poor - i even tried dragging the floor lamp from the bedroom into the bathroom to assist, but the single lumen it gave off was of no help.the bathroom has no vent, so any smells that are generated in the vicinity of the toilet linger throughout the room indefinitely. we used the hotel lobby bathroom for our more aromatic duties.when we first entered the room, we thought the glass panel between the bathroom and bedroom was really cool. however, at 7am when i got up to get ready, and my husband had the luxury of another hour and a half of sleep, the cool factor wore off quickly. although the bathroom lighting is horrible, it's enough to keep the person on the other side of the glass wall awake.housekeeping was below average. one night we returned to find that all of our dirty towels had been taken, and no clean ones left. also, the bottom sheet was never tucked into the mattress, but laid across the top, leaving us to make our beds each night, lest we end up with the bottom sheet wadded up in the middle of the bed. since i don't even make my bed at home, i was not excited about this feature of the hotel.the common spaces are very spacious and comfortable. there is no hot tub, which was a disappointment, and because the pool is at the top of the hotel, the wind kept us from enjoying a late-night swim. but, it is nice that the pool is open most of the night.the staff was very pleasant, especially the porters upon check-in. kudos to them for keeping their chins up.\"let me start by saying that i have stayed in other w hotels and had a great time, this one is just not up to the w standard at all.i checked in for a 6 night stay for work and i had requested a high floor prior to arriving and am a spg member so they did give me a room on the 15th floor, that had a connecting door with a screaming baby and from what it sounded like a toddler(s) as well. the concierge brie was lovely and moved me herself to a quieter room, but said someone else had complained about that room earlier and moved. so why put another guest there?the room i was moved to was shoddy around the edges, the decor is fading at this location. carpets are not really clean, roman shades shredded a bit, chipped edges on the lacquer furniture. also no robes or clock radio, which i called down for and were sent up.there was an herbalife convention staying at the hotel, so going to the rooftop pool was out of the question, it is not big enough for the crowd it attracts and beyond noisy. the valet parking (no other option is &37./night) and even if you call down for your car 15-20 minutes beforehand, be prepared to wait and cool your heels on the hot pavement. the 2nd evening of my stay, i returned after a steamy hot day working outside around 6 pm and my room had not been made up, i called down to ask and all the front desk would say is housekeeping was not finished cleaning the rooms for the day\" really? so since the lobby and pool were overcrowded i went to the bliss spa and treated myself to a wonderful mani/pedi by corinne and a great massage as well.the food at the adjacent blt steak was delicious and i ate there several nights in a row, just as pricey as the room service but so much better.housekeeping continued to be lacking and even with all the lights on in the room it was dark as a disco.\"hated my experience at this hotel, yes the building is beautiful and most of the staff are friendly, but if you have any morals at all you will feel incredibly uncomfortable. i felt like i was spending the night in a club. the ammenities were pretty such as the pool but i didnt get to enjoy them because there were so many drunk people, the next morning the pool was empty but i wasnt about to swim in it because it was green and had things floating in it from the night before (use your imagination). the rooms were nice but my husband and i were sharing a room with my parents and you could see into the shower from the bedroom ( glass shower wall ) which was extremely akward and forced us to have to shower in the dark just for privacy, you have to pay for everything including wifi which is rediculous no coffee in the rooms only stuff laying around that they try to trick you into eating or drinking like water and snacks so that you can add another 100 dollars to your bill at checkout. i was very dissapointed in the overall experience i was excited and was hoping for an experience like the ritz carlton which i stayed at a week prior and loved but that was not the case. im just glad it was for only one night and we were all adults, do not take your children here!! im not a picky person when it comes to hotels as long as they are clean i only stayed here for the experience but let me tell you i would much rather stay at a holiday inn than this place, i will never stay here again!i had never been to atlanta so i was excited to spend my birthday there and after looking at pictures online i couldn't wait to get there.this was supposed to be a wonderful birthday surprise, and that exactly what i got. when we pulled up on a friday night (july 15) it was clearly a busy night. didn't bother us because we actually looked forward to having some drinks and music in our hotel. the valet was unorganized and blunt and i understand that it was busy but i felt rushed and unwelcome there looked to be a mixture of people getting in and out of cars but if you ask me if i'm checking in and i say yes it would have been nice to just have someone ask if we need a cart and help us with the bags. no we had to ask and we also received a glare then once a cart was retrieved my bags we placed on the cart and pushed to the lobby where i met with my boyfriend while he was checking in. the gentleman at the counter was polite and was a complete professional.the room was clean, spacious and the view was amazing.the bed was very very uncomfortable.i have slept on carpet that was softer then this bed the couch had more cushion and spring it then this bed. i can honestly say i would have been better off sleeping on an air mattress. i was completely dissatisfied and it was not a good start to the weekend.the next day july 16 (my birthday ) we called down for valet since it was a very hot day we waited for about 7-10 min till we made our our way downstairs to no car . after asking several people if the car was on the way we eventually got someone to actually go in the office where they keys were and then send someone for the car.while we wait in the heat.this trip aside from being with my boyfriend was completely disappointing. i do not plan on ever returning to this hotel chain. i was expecting so much more seeing how we spent more to have a better experience and the only thing received was a good viewmy husband booked this room as a surprise family get away. it was a surprise alright! the room was disgusting to say the least and that is being kind. none of the surfaces had been wiped down for a long time. there was a dirty moldy towel left under the sink. the minibar and snacks had not been restocked from the previous person that stayed there. we brought it to the hotel's attention and they charged us for it. there is security in the building however it took three different attempts to get them to quiet the people down in the room next to us. the last attempt made around 2am. dealing with two sleep deprived teenage girls does not make for a very relaxing vacation. this was our first and needless to say our last stay at a w hotel.this property is not at the w standard. i had problems in several areas which i had to address with the front desk management. there was 45+ minute wait for car although parking is $32 a day. i had to call to get toiletries replenished..and to make matters worse i requested wake up call 2 days and both days they did not honor the request although i complained with the front desk management after the first occurrence. yes, the management did compensate however i am sure it was after they found out i was a starwood gold for life member. i felt like i paid for 5 star service but got 2 stars. i could have stayed at aloft hotel and got better service.posting this as a warning to dog owners. i cancelled my reservation before i arrived as the result of rude customer service. the hotel says that it accepts pets. i had booked a room and had included information that we were bringing our dog. i did not hear anything so i called and was told that they charge $100 plus $25 a night. i'm more than happy to pay some pet fee (i get that dogs can be a pain) but hotels such as kimpton do not charge anything for pets. so i expressed surprise at the high price and mentioned that kimpton and other hotels do not charge any pet fees. the customer service rep was very short with me and said this is starwood.\" i'm aware of that - i'm a starwood member. so i cancelled, called loews atlanta, spoke with a wonderful representative who was helpful and pleasant, got me a great rate, a bigger room, and set us up with the dog for a much, much lower fee. wish i could have had the starwood points but it wasn't worth it given the poor customer service. the manager at starwood was very pleasant when i called to let her know and to cancel.\"i selected the w downtown hotel for the night of my wedding stay.prior my i stay, i reached out to the hotel to have my room set up for a special bride and groom wedding night. i asked for chocolate strawberries, rose petals and whatever else they could do to make the room romantic and a special evening.i specifically had a conversation with someone where when i asked if there was a concierge to help, they coarsely responded that there were no concierges at the hotel; but that they had resources called insider's; and the person whom i was talking to could give me a hand.so i made my request and gave the person on the line the time i would be arriving and the things i would like to have in the room.while making my request, the person helping me specifically said to me, don't worry, we will make sure that your room will be set up, and your requests will be accommodated.\"when arriving at my room, the only thing that was in the room was a bottle of champagne, and it was not cold on ice or anything.this completely screwed up my special night, so i reached out to the hotel, and they responded with an apologetic email, although i did not feel that it was sincere for the reason that there was not an acceptance of the ball being dropped; but rather a cover up or explanation in my eyes.i responded to the email explaining my feelings and informing the guest experience resource that i had at the least expected some courtesy compensation such as reward points to make up for the mistake, although no one has responded.i chose the w hotel over the mandarin hotel, and i now see that i made a big mistake.as a preferred (previous ambassador/platinum; now gold status member; at the minimum i would at least expect some courtesy points to compensate for the lost special surprise moments anticipated i cannot get back.\"overall my experience with the w hotel was poor.¬† the room was nice, modern, and clean and the location is good but the rest of the stay was lacking.¬† when we checked in at 10pm we asked if the pool was open and were told it was closed. the next day we were told it was open 24 hours.¬† we called the front desk our first morning and asked about a coffee maker. we we're told that the hotel did not provide coffee makers and our only option for coffee was with room service at $9 a cup. later we were actually told that they had coffee makers available for rooms and they would put one in our room. when checking in we were told that a car service was available for free within a two-mile area of the hotel. when we used the car service we found out after we had been dropped off that it was for drop off only and we would have to take a taxi back to the hotel. it was implied that if we gave him a big enough tip he would come get us. i'm not sure what the point of having a car available for drop off only is. the pool area is nice however they searched my wife's purse and confiscated her water. he said no outside food or drinks including bottled water. when i go to a restaurant i assume that i cannot take outside food or drinks but when i pay over $250 a night for a hotel i feel like i should be able to take my own water or soda or whatever to the swimming pool.¬† and to go to the extent of searching my wife's purse is both ridiculous¬† and insulting! they did not clean or replace our coffee mugs each day. we also had to ask for more coffee every morning. i think the whatever whenever\" moto is really \"we charge you for whatever whenever we like\".\"travel frequently for business, often staying 50-100+ nights a year in starwood properties. arrived at the w atlanta with a confirmed reservation late at night, was told my room was given away. received no courtesy call or email. they scrambled to find an alternative, leaving me to wait for 45+ minutes at a very late hour. sent me to a motel that was not nearly comparable in quality. this was all while traveling for work - that cut out productivity and sleep.the reservation was confirmed - and on top of that, platinum guests have guaranteed availability. the worst was just not bothering to give a courtesy phone call or email ahead of time, to at least save me the time of traveling to the hotel. had no follow-up apology, just deposited a small amount of points into my account which does not nearly compensate for the experience.i have always received a notice asking to confirm that i'll be arriving at other hotels when they were overbooked, including others in atlanta. would recommend alternatives for their approach to service.this is a party/club hotel with a tiny pool and the darkest purple and black d√©cor throughout we have ever experienced. at check in my husband and i were a bit put off when i had to ‚äúdeclare all people in my room,‚äù (pause), ‚äúfor safety reasons in case of an evacuation‚äù (of course) and the person registering us ‚äúwouldn‚äôt have bothered us with it if we were only staying one night‚äù (thursday). we stayed 3 nights thursday-sunday. this is definitely not a place for kids and if you want to make some new friends make sure you declare them to the front desk before going up to your room. we were surprised the rooms weren‚äôt hourly!the rooms are incredibly small and there was absolutely no privacy. the open concept shower in the middle of the room left very little privacy for couples and/or families but would be fantastic for exhibitionists. the room did, however, have an overpriced bar with overpriced snacks and our room even came with an overpowering bonus smell too. we did not find any retreat in this room as the walls were like cardboard and all conveniences came with hefty price tags. we did not love hearing every single siren or loud vehicle from the highway view either.we also found the ‚äúwhatever, whenever‚äù service was spotty and if you ask three different people the same question, you will definitely get three very different answers based on how generous the individual felt.we would not recommend this hotel to anyone.i reserved a room with a king bed this morning at a guaranteed rate for that reservation. upon arrival i was told they were out of kings but could give me 2 queens. understand, i did not request a king, i reserved a king. there is a difference. if i had wanted 2 beds i would have reserved 2 beds.first time we stayed here we booked a special on spg's web site and when we checked out the hotel charged us full rate. when i presented proof of the special the hotel refused to honor the special and said we would have to call back during the week. it took a week of emails, calls, and letters to get a refund of the difference.i thought the first trip was an anomaly but obviously it is the 'get over' hotel...starting with one positive:- location (in downtown just blocks away from centennial olympic park and monuments).and then a couple of service lapses:- room service -- ordered a huge steak and sides from their heavily-touted blt steak\" room service while preparing to leave for an event. we're fans of the blt restaurants in nyc so i booked this hotel in part because of the restaurant. the operator tried to connect me 3 times to room service and eventually they had to call me back a while later. when they finally called back, it was 5pm and the room service person -- who was also the food delivery person -- (which might be the problem) told me to expect the order within 30-40 minutes but that they'd try to \"rush it up\".... it finally arrived about an hour after the initial call -- and parts of it were lukewarm at best and cool at worst.. and the bill was a whopping $127.00 (not including tip). i scarfed down a few bites and was eventually late to the event but needless to say that meal wasn't being paid for.- i reached for one of the complimentary water bottles for spg members, only to realize it was already open and almost half empty. just another example of atrocious housekeeping (which has been a recurring theme at many spg stays lately).\"great hotel, great staff, but not a good place to stay if you are traveling for business and actually need to sleep during the night. lots of kids/young adults partying (loudly). i will never stay here again on a business trip. definitely a better choice if you are on vacation.i have some concerns and complaints about my current stay at the w in downtown atlanta. i came here this weekend to stay at your hotel for my 21st birthday and was immediately dissatisified with my decision when i was checking in. i booked two rooms under my name for my friend and i. i requested us to be in conjoined rooms since we came to celebrate our birthdays together and explained that to whom i booked with over the phone. i understand that it was only a request and you all would do what you could, but i got here at check in for the person that was checking me in to tell me she couldn't find my reservation at all. after atleast 30 minutes of her searching through the computer my reservation was finally found of which i had the confirmation code for upon my arrival. my room, the cool corner room\", was given to me on the 5th floor. mind you the only reason i chose this specific room for my stay was to have the cool corner room with a view. being placed on the 5th floor i looked out my window to see nothing but the next building aside our hotel. i was very dissatisfied and my friends room was all the way on the 11th floor, nowhere near mine and she had a way better view in a \"fabulous king room\" which was atleast $200 cheaper than the room i booked, which made absolutely no sense for me to be paying that much more for way less of an experience. i immediately went back to the check in desk and expressed how i felt about my room. the supervisor james was nice enough to offer me another room which was a step down from the one i booked but on a higher floor. during all of this a charge was put on my card for the amount of $815. my first room was only around $600 and the room i had to change to was $482. i still do not understand why a hold in that large amount had to be placed on my card and when i asked about it and how i would be able to get the difference put back in my account, i was told they couldn't do anything about until checkout and i won't receive the money back for 3-5 days after that. this was a huge inconvenience for me and being that i came in town from orlando, fl i had a set budget and your hotel has yet to accommodate me for this. aside from that the w hotel staff here has been nothing but rude every time i had a question and concern from the receptionists at the checkin desk to the person taking room service orders, which was unexpected. excluding the supervisor james he was very helpful throughout this weekend. i chose the w downtown atlanta for my birthday weekend specifically because i thought i would enjoy my stay with no complaints. instead i am completely dissatisfied and i look forward to hearing from you all. thank you for your time.\"thought i was going to splurge on a wonderful luxurious hotel... nothing but a money trap... the hotel room is extremely small for a double... and you only get one robe... the tub is deep but small... no plus size guest for this room... paid over $450 and another $37 for parking... they still wanted $10 for basic wifi and $15 for the streaming wifi... i called down to the operator being that the room says free wifi... and the gentleman said nope... it costs... there's even a charge for the wired internet in the room. waterbottles all over the room... that runs about $6.00 a bottle... snack cost too.. i stayed at a cheaper hotel last year, and they actually surprised me with a gift card the year before that another hotel had me a basket of snacks... and both hotels charged less than $150 a night and were suites ... the pool is nice... outside, heated... but no top cover... so if it's raining, which it is today, you'll get rained on... the gentleman through helped bring up the bags and the check in lady was the absolute best! he even called down to someone to bring me a drink for my bday..... it never came... was going to stay two nights... but i definitely will not be... not worth almost $500 a night ...bday ruinedi stayed in this hotel on a recent business trip to atlanta. i am a loyal spg member so i booked this hotel after reading reviews and because of good location of the hotel. after a long trip from west coast i checked into this hotel around 11pm at night and they decided to put me in one of the worst rooms even though i upgraded to fabulous room as recommended on their website. after i checked in to the room, the first thing i saw was the cable box hanging on the wall with wires dangling next to tv but that did not bother me too much since i was really hungry and wanted to order some food so i can go to bed as soon as possible. when i tried to call in room dining the phone was not dialing and i kept pressing house keeping, in room dining etc. and none of the numbers worked so i went to the lobby and mentioned the issue to which he said that a technician would check the phone in couple of minutes so i went back to the room and kept waiting for 30 min. no one showed up until 12 so i went back to the lobby and requested to change the room so at least i can order some food. the person at reception did not bother to change the room and told me that if i pressed other buttons such as 9, 7 and insisted that he will have someone check the phone. at this point i did not have any option so i went back to the room. finally technician showed up after 15 min and he said that the phone is broken since he could not also dial any number.... i was impressed with his troubleshooting skills... sigh. so i went back to the lobby and they finally gave me a different room. it was 1am at that point. the other shocker was an incorrect charge of $52 under munchie box, i did not even touch the mini bar or snacks in my room and they sent me an updated folio showing this charge. i am sad to say that i would try to stay away from w brand next time i am traveling as this has left a bad taste. the only reason i am giving 2 stars is for the dining service as they were quick enough to serve the food once i ordered and it was one of the best flat bread pizza i ever had.location is great...amenities are not. the wifi in the room was shoddy which was very annoying to deal with. there were crumbs and dirt on the couch. the curtains had stains. things like the lamps look cool at first glance,but are really just plasticky and cheap. there aren't a lot of television channels. they have huge bottles of smart water next to your bed and in the bathroom with a tag that says 'drink up(maybe trying to confuse people into thinking they are complimentary) but are actually $6. paint coming off the walls..panels coming apart, and curtains coming apart..spider webs in the light fixtures, the separate makeup mirror light in the bathroom was broken..etc.the bathrobe was nasty and frayed all over. in the corners along the sides of the hallways and the rooms it is dirty. carpet comes up between the window and floor in the room. we notified the hotel of our complaints and requested to change rooms...they refused. also, the staff act like immature teenagers(snickering because i carried my pillow through the lobby to the elevator) and we decided to park across the street, so we carried our luggage in and when we first walked in past the valet people, instead of them saying something like \"welcome to the w\" they just laughed as we walked in. and another time we were coming in we overheard a valet person say to another about a car that wasn't a range rover \"who gon drive that in here?\"poorly trained. you couldn't pay me to stay here again.\"it's alive and well in the atlanta downtown w hotel. i stayed there one night for business. if you like a throbbing beat in the elevator on your way to a breakfast meeting at 7:00 am then this is the place for you. the lobby could be a dance floor. they just need the rotating, mirrored ball. the room was fine, although i wondered a moment about what might have caused the stains on the belt of the robe hanging in the bathroom. this is a hotel pretending to be a hip club, and be aware that the people staying in the room next to yours may be pretending to be hip partiers, and the walls, although not like paper, are like cardboard. i was awakened after midnight by those wanna be hipsters by 45 minutes of loud and excited talk and repeated slams of the door to their room. no, management, i did not call the desk. i did not want to change rooms- getting out of bed, dressing, packing my things, waiting for the bellman with the new room key, etc at 1:00 am or later. i will ask meeting organizers to avoid w hotels, or i will pass on the meeting. w, after all, is not intended ffor business people. the w hotels are for people who regret they missed the disco era.the hotel seemed nice but it was more of a party hotel than a nice hotel. very dark with cheap decorations. our family was woken up from drunk people in the hall several times. to have valet park you is $33.00 overnight. the only thing i liked about this hotel was the bath products. this hotel reminded me of a club in my twenties not a place for my family and i which included a mini bar very low that i had to move everything.omg !!! very nice !!! the beds are sooooooo nice !!! i'll be staying here every chance i get !!!!!! bliss spa amazinggggggggggggggg!!! this was truly an a amazing hotel !!! thank you for a wonderful stay !!! and thank the staff as well !! thank you !!having stayed at the w hoboken, i was expecting a repeat (stellar)performance, with with some southern hospitality thrown in. my mistake. instead, i was crushed by the shabbiness of the place. i arrived at my room to see drip marks on the bathroom wall. i shrugged it off, thinking they would get it the next day, but next day's housekeeping missed that, as well as cleaning the mirror and wiping/dusting, so i thought i would let management know, politely, and that the window treatment was falling down. that window treatment stayed hanging down for the entire week, the housekeeping remained sub par (i reduced my daily tip to $2- a day. after i washed the wall myself.), and it just got worse. room service had to check to see what was in the vegetable salad, and when they returned back to the phone reported greens, tomatoes, onions and avocados\". \"boring\" i thought, but was surprised to find corn, hearts of palm, red cabbage, radishes and one or two other goodies. good thing i preferred that.the \"living room\" had tattered menus and a rug that literally needed a trim of hanging yarn, in addition to a shampoo. the general take was one of neglect and dirt throughout. now i don't doubt it's a fun bar for some, but it's dark at night, and that would help the atmosphere immensely.i wanted to make sure that i wasn't overreacting, so i asked other guests at the pool what they thought. i kept it neutral, no comment or \"tell\" from me. boy did i get an earful of complaints. so i knew it wan't me.the two hopes for the place are the concierges. and all the rest of the staff was friendly, although inept.glad to see some other folk had a good time there. sure wan't my experience, particularly after reporting to the manager: no improvement, not even a follow up call. i answered the survey they sent honestly, and received an apology email.just wish i would have stayed elsewhere. i was so disappointed.\"to the point: this is not a family hotel. a friend from college and i stayed there for a beer drinking weekend. what we were greeted by was an oddly laid out lobby; it wasn`t at all clear where we were supposed to check in. the lobby was dark, decorated in purple and black, as was our room. it was reasonably clean, with a nicely stocked mini-bar, which included a pack of condoms (which creeped me out a little). another odd feature was the almost opaque wall in the shower. eeeewwww. the beds were comfy, though. at checkout, we were again faced with the oddly configured lobby, which was woefully understaffed. it took us forever to check out.no worries, though. we just didn`t know what we were getting when we booked the room. i`m just chalking this one up to experience. the w may be just the place for some folks, just not me.finally, i can post a review on this property without my full name showing up!why is this important?well, because my experience had very few good points.the good:- shaheen- carly- blt steak (and our server, david i believe?)- location (in atl and near marta)- return of portion of stay due to various issuesshaheen was the person who checked my friend and i in in aug/sept 2014; he was amazing, and always pleasant. she personally redid our room keys twice (maybe thrice) over our stay (like five days), and i always felt bad having to ask for her to do it again.david (i think that was his name), our server at blt, was an engaging and entertaining guy. he really gave us some help and suggestions when we were looking at the menu and talking about getting the wine flights with our meals. blt overall was amazing, and i'm so glad we did that for our first meal of our stay.marta was just around the block, also, so when i had to go to and from atl during my stay it made it easy to take public transport (and therefore save money on rental/parking.the bad:- did not process prepay, only took deposit- one manager horrible to deal with- phone not working properly upon check-in- keys kept demagnetizing- downgraded when changing rooms and told was being given a credit\" due to the room change- communication after check-out regarding issuesi got a prepay rate for the stay, and so didn't even think about it when i didn't see the whole amount taken immediately. i had other stuff to think about, and surprise surprise they didn't charge the remaining amount until i checked in! this was horrible, and one of the reasons that i ended up pursuing the majority of my stay charges being refunded after my stay. prepay rate meens fully charged immediately!speaking of room rate, we had multiple problems with our room - the view was spectacular, but you could hear cars from the freeway, all emergency vehicles on the street, etc, from the fourteeth floor. the sink wasn't draining, our phones didn't work for the first two days... and when we moved they said we would get a discount... but it was a completely separate room category!when we reported that we ether wanted to move rooms or go to a different w/spg property, the concierge we had to deal with (i'm sorry, i don't remember her name) was a pill. she looked like she didn't want to be there, didn't want to deal with us, and sent us away instead of trying to fix the issue immediately.the valet service was also spotty - the first day we took it the guy was awesome, but it seemed like he was never there! they were also totally unwilling to help my friend in figuring how to get a taxi or other transportation back to atl (pretty sure it was the same concierge),and told her \"just to walk to the marta station\" -she has mobility issues and that was not a acceptable solution.the keys demagnetized four times during our five day stay, at least now, most of the time they were totally helpful at getting this redone. but we changed where we were keeping the keys and no matter what they did they demagnetized! i don't know what was going on with their machines but it was not where we were keeping them!now......the ugly.we mostly went down to the lobby bar to get breakfast, but on saturday since i was leaving later, we ended up ordering from the catering menu in our room. i described changes i wanted for my dish, in depth, and nothing was said about the menu being new, or that the item i was ordering was different than what they had on their menu description.the dish came up and right away i noticed something was amiss - i thought it was just my eggs and when i called down i described what i saw on my plate and the whatever whenever employee still didn't say anything and said they'd see what they could do, sending someone up immediately specifically i mentioned that the dish had cheese curds and picked one up and crumbled it between my fingers.when the person came up to pick up the dish, they mentioned the new menu and said \"oh, and crab\" when describing the dish. i recoiled and washed my hands twice, for the third time in twenty minutes. i immediately told her that i was allergic to shellfish, and started getting worried. i made it clear i hadn't eaten any, but that if i had... medical bills would have been on them.while i was waiting for my new dish to come back up, they called and offered a comp of this meal and 100$ credit towards in-room dining for this situation. because i wasn't feeling sick yet, i was fine. i started eating the dish when it came up and felt pretty good until about 3/4 of the way through but chalked that up to the richness of the meal.we then went outside to wait for a shuttle to the convention we were going to and although slightly warm it wasn't bad. then i started to feel extremely sick and nauseous, and the colour drained from my upper body. i thought it might have jsut been the heat still, so i thought i'd stay in for the day and... i wanted to collapse when i hit the front foyer ac. i did decide to collapse a little against the front desk, because the nausea and dizziness i felt was getting worse.i ended up providing a statement to security (i think) about what was happening, but i knew i had caught it early enough that i just needed water and to relax in the room most of the day. my friend was worried and so her day was shot as well. all i wanted was to be allowed to drink the expensive bottled water and not be charged, but the manager on duty (i assume the concierge we dealt with) said no way, but carly said she's get some of the dasani free water up. but that never happened. my friend even was going to out and get benadryl from a cvs because that would help, and carly did bring up some pills they had in the back. from their own stash of medicines.and you want to know what they considered compensation? 3000 spg points. i asked for something completely different as compensation (free water at first, then refunding of all my stay charges) and have now received this (most of my stay charges). they can't tell me why the food issue happened because of their practices, and there's no official report because i didn't go to the hospital. i do know, however, that the restaurant was visited.telling everyone i can to not stay here, canceling my spg acct, recommending they not stay at starwood properties... and of course, reported the entire incident to the convention i was attending so this place can be removed from their \"overflow\" hotel list. of course, i checked the convention overflow hotel list and they're still there... so if you're going to dragoncon do not stay here.\"came here to celebrate fianc√© birthday and fathers day, check in was less than professional, clerk that checked us in asked for my credit card info just in case we consumed room incidents (ridiculous prices - trump would be an idiot to pay $7 for 99¬¢ bottle of water) only to find later that morning my card was debited $100. i had to inquire to find out. my question, if card on file, debit as u go but just take without asking?? major no-no. for that nightly price, there is no free wifi in individual room either. i should not be mandated to lobby to browse free for that price. the red roof inn gives free wifi. hell mega bus offer free wifi. now at check out the clerk says great no incidentals consumed we were clear of that charge only to see a $6 debit from the w. the principles behind this amazes me, lack of communication is the bedrock of deception and be hard pressed to utilize hotel again.i stayed here november 6th through the 9th 2014. i had an amazing time in the city. my hotel was beautiful the room was really nice. it was expensive but worth every penny. no parking but had to valet it was about $30 per night. my only complaint was that a drunken group of individuals entered the hotel and came to my floor and began to bang on a door nobody answered and my sleep was ruined. other than that the w\" was what you would expect simply amazing.\"i thought the w was a great chain with good amenities and great rooms.. i was so wrong... it was dated.. the furnishings were beat up. the bathroom fixtures leak and dont function well.. the staff was nice and the bar was fun downstairs.. the beds were really comfortable.. the towels thin.. i was really disappointed and i will stay elsewhere if i come back to atlantafirst off i would like to start with the fact that i have never stepped foot in this hotel, my disdain stems from my interactions with the hotel management.i made a reservation for 3 nights, not online but with an actual reservation agent. i should have taken her name, but i did not (my fault). she was abrupt and seemed annoyed that i disturbed her- clue number one ! i gave her my cc# and she hung up. mind you, i have made reservations with other hotels, and they make sure to alert you of their policies with regards to not cancelling your reservation. never during my brief conversation was i warned that my cc would be charged for one nights stay, if i did not call and cancel my reservation.fast forward to the weekend of my trip.. my flight was delayed and by delayed i mean i was not even sure if i would be flying out of nyc to atlanta that night. after the airport shenanigans, i finally arrive in atlanta, almost 8 hours after the reservation. i ended up staying with a friend who was kind enough to pick me up at 4am after waiting forever for my luggage. the last thing on my mind was cancelling my hotel reservation at this oh so kind and understanding hotel, because to be honest i was in a whirlwind when i landed ! at this point it is after 5 am t, and something told me to check my cc# - whoa !the w charged me for one nights stay- $315.82. i immediately called and spoke to a gentleman who was actually nice (this time) and i told him my situation, he forwarded my information to the manager, and here is where my disgust begins.1- no one from the w contacted me - yet !2- i never received an email or phone call from the manager, even after sending an email to him.3- i understand the policies, however what happened to common courtesy ? someone could call me to reiterate what was never told to me in the first place.i called my cc company and they were given the okie doke\" as well, passed along various extensions with no one acknowledging their questions about the charge on my account.at this point, the money is gone... but the lack of professionalism from this hotel is really disappointing. i shared my story, not to deter possible guests from lodging here, but to make sure that management is made aware of this.\"i have stayed at many ws across the country and this one was by far the worst. i arrived at 5:45 and they did not have my room ready. i sat at the bar for over an hour and waited. they gave me a free drink ticket after i had already closed my tab. the parking was unorganized and it took a long time to get my car when i need to leave the next day. work out center was nice. not anything like i expected and i will not stay here in the future.i stayed for a total of four nights from wednesday to sunday in mid-january in 2015 and initially had a corner room on the 10th floor. earlier during my stay i was fairly satisfied for the most part. i have enjoyed my stay previously at various w's and appreciated the lifestyle. w atlanta downtown was no exception at first and the location was perfect and within walking distance from most downtown attractions. the staff was friendly and responsive.however, things began to go horribly wrong when i woke up one morning and found parts of the carpet were soaked. i quickly realized there was water everywhere and was disgusted to find out that the source of the water was the toilet! apparently there had been a plumbing disaster and i had been stepping on sewage since waking up. you had to see it to believe things like this could happen at a w!an engineer was dispatched and i was moved to another room. the choice i was offered was between a suite at a lower floor and a regular room on a higher floor. i did not want to be downgraded to a regular room (i had a corner room) so i went with the suite. the suite was, well, bigger for sure, but had a few issues, too. whenever the heat came on, a humming mechanical noise would also come out of the vent. while this was somewhat understandable and tolerable, the noise on saturday night from the bar at the lobby with live dj was literally through the roof and went right into my room directly above on the fourth floor. unbelievably loud noise persisted through 2 am!after these major annoyances, i thought i was going home disappointed-- i was not sure if the front desk would inquire or care enough that i was not happy about my stay. but turned out they did. the manager of the hotel offered significant amount of conciliatory refund for the nights that i was unsatisfied. it did take a while for the funds to be returned to my card since i booked through a third party, but i appreciated the gesture.we stayed at the w for 4 nights while attending a convention. the hotel was packed full, but their service remained excellent.in particular, carly at the front desk was an absolute joy. whenever we saw her, she cheerfully greeted us. on the few occasions we made a request, not only did she remember our room number, but it was all handled without the least effort on our part.their valet was also very friendly and helpful.the hotel is clean, and has a very upbeat and modern vibe.in summary, carly's level of service and friendliness was reminisce of our recent stays at the disney resorts! that says it all.bravo!wow as i read other people reviews i must have arrived on the wrong day when the friendly staff were gone for the day. room staff was great. unfortunately everything at night always looks great but day time you see the hotel, hotel room and bathroom in the day its like whoa its in great need of tlc. room smelled muggy, tv wasn't working well. beautiful pool and lil restaurant had the checkin desk at time of checking in mentioned these amenities maybe we would have enjoyed it much more. i was there with a group of 4 for airport conference and out of all the hotels we chose w\" because of the great experience we've always have had. if was a crazy weekend saints were in town but still no reason for check in to be soo unwelcoming. at 7am there was a kid running up and down the hall way screaming for about 15 min till i finally called normally at any other w hotel there is someone who goes up and down the elevator stopping this from happening.\"tip: at these high rates, find a better choice. this hotel has a ways to go to be a high-end hotel, but they sure charge high-end prices. the hot water took for ever to get hot, the shower is poorly designed and water gets all over the floor, the tv controller was terrible (and yes it had new batteries), i'm only 510\", but the way the bed and matters are designed and installed, my feet were hanging over the edge. we call for help taking down the luggage at a non-busy time, but they forgot about us and never came.\"i had a wonderful and relaxing massage at bliss spa at the w atlanta downtown. i was greeted by name, given a glass of champagne, and warmly welcomed by my massage therapist, amber thompson. i had the bliss 75 massage.proswalking distance 15 minutes to convention centerwalking distance to restaurants24 hour rooftop pool in seasonmarta stop one block away - i often take marta from the airport to this hotel to avoid atl trafficconsmany rooms facing office buildingi read the reviews here and thought i was going to a great hotel--not! much like rebecca said, the hotel room was dirty and the furniture was tattered and worn. the hotel staff was ok\". some of the folks were really nice and others need to find a new job. the valet lied to me about parking which resulted in $30/day parking. if you decide to book, make sure you get parking included or park in the garage across the street for like $5. my stay was horrible! i booked the fabulous room and it was nothing fabulous about it. note: the shower is visible from any point in the room (which is extremely small) because it's glass, so, don't bunk with anyone who you don't want to see naked at some point, lol. i was too disgusted to try any of the amenities.\"the lobby was nice, but the room was gross, and their was dried blood on the sheets and dried food on the walls!!!! and they also didn't even give you clean towels and they only gave you one bar of soap! a motel 6 is cleaner than the w and that's just sad....i am in the hotel right now. during check in on 20th sep, we were handed a letter saying that the water will be cut off on sunday, 21st @ 1.00am. well the date and time now is the 22nd of sept @ 1.00am and the water was cut off when my wife was in the middle of her shower. staff was totally unapologetic when i called to complain and insisted that i interpreted the letter wrongly. at no point was they sympathetic about our plight and they just took an attitude that they were not in the wrong. i understood that there was nothing they could do but the least they could do was to be more sympathetic to their hotel guest.i got the spa package at the hotel, and it was such as nice solo weekend! very comfortable room and great service. the bliss spa was great! i had amber as my massage therapist, and she was so great! the smells in the spa and great back massage was just what i needed. love to visit again.my girlfriend and i bought gift certificates to the bliss spa in the w hotel through travelzoo.com. the certificates specifically included time by the rooftop pool. my friend and i called months in advance to schedule our appointments at the same time and confirmed during that conversation that we could enjoy our spa service and then lunch by the pool together that day. we were so looking forward to a fun mid-morning/early afternoon. that day when we arrived we were told that the pool was closed because one of the glass wall panels had broken. we were very disappointed. however we spoke with the w hotel manager of guest services who agreed we could come back another time to enjoy lunch by the pool. he gave us his card and said there would be no problem we just had to call in advance. several weeks later i called the number on the manager's card to arrange for our raincheck visit. i left a message explaining the circumstances for my call. a week later having received no response i called again and asked to be called back. with absolutely no response to the second call after a week i called a third time again asking to be called back. it has been another week since the third call. i find the failure to return my calls to be highly unprofessional and perhaps reflects what one can expect from the ws guest services.on a plus note, the valet service was terrific; very positive, responsive and polite. the valet crew clearly take pride in their work. and the massage received by kimberly at bliss was fantastic. i highly recommend her.the hotel is funky, the bed is really comfy, but i was left feeling very short changed after our 2 night stay. nothing in the room is complimentary, not even a bottle of water. everything has a price tag. when you're paying well north of 200 dollars a night, you'd expect to get at least something complimentary. not even a coffee machine in the room, that's room service and $9 each for a drink in the morning. parking is mandatory valet for which they charge $30 per night. there is very limited space to pull up in outside the hotel which means you are hurried out of the car, then when you come to get out you are blocked in by all the other cars that have been requested from the garage. we sat outside for 10 minutes unable to leave. which is ridiculous when you're paying for the privilege. the hotel does not have enough lifts. you will end up stopping at each and every floor to pick people up or drop them off, if it isn't already full when it gets to you.there is a limited supply of restaurants and bars within walking distance. the concierge recommend several restaurants that are all a drive away, so you might as well stay at a better value hotel further from downtown.imagine our disappointment when we headed up to the 16th floor pool to relax and swim - only to find 200 of local 20-somethings crammed into the pool/bar with blasting music!!! i guess they forgot to mention that on sundays in the summer they open the doors to the public for a pool party. did they pay $359 a night? don't think so. also - our toilet ran all night (loudly)- hotel needs fresh paint and cleaned up.stayed at this hotel the weekend of memorial day. there was nothing impressive about this property at all. my room was dusty and needed a good cleaning. i am actually appalled at the service and professionalism of the staff and the parking services. if you can't find any other place to lay your head for the night and you must stay at the w downtown atlanta, i caution you, don't let them park your car! i watched from my window and in-person, while waiting for my car, valet staff were not being careful or respectful of customer's cars. they brought one lady the wrong car. to top it all off they damaged mine, lied, and did not repair the damage to my recently purchased range rover. the valet manager on duty told me, that my car would be repaired and this sort of thing happens all the time. the first payment had not been made and now in addition to making payments, i need to pay out-of-pocket to repair damage to my bumper, damaged by the valet at w downtown atlanta. as of today, i still haven't heard back from the manager who was supposed to be addressing my customer service complaint submitted both online and by phone. he last words to me, i will get back to you in about a week.\" 3 to 4 weeks and have passed and no word.in addition, i was not offered any of the benefits of being a loyal member of the spg program. i have been a member for a few years and whenever, i visit atlanta my group stays at starwood properties and have also recommended them to colleagues, friends, and family and this is the kind of treatment i get.\"we drove 5 hours to this hotel based on reviews we read. once we arrived and checked in we were severely disappointed. the valet was too busy talking to other people to tell us where to go so we could check in and get our luggage out of our car. after we navigated through the large group of drunk people hanging out in front of the door we went to check in at the front desk. it was so loud i thought i was in a night club not a hotel. once we got to our room we were greeted with dust and chipped paint on the furniture. the room was very small for the amount we paid. the beds were very soft though. it took 15 minutes to get our luggage to the room which was not a fun experience since we had just drove 5 hours and had a baby with a wet diaper. the valet would not let us take our bags with us when we got out of the car. my husband went to walk around the hotel to check out the pool and other amenities that were offered and within 10 minutes he quickly returned to the room due to all the people smoking pot and the fear of the affects second hand smoke would have on our 8 month old. we had intended on staying two days but we checked out less than 12 hours after we checked in. no one even bothered to ask us why we were checking out early. also no one even bothered to ask us about our stay until the valet gave us our keys to leave. definitely not a family environment. if you want an over priced night club environment this is for you. we went with high hopes and intentions of spending a lot of money on a nice room when we probably would have been better off at a days inn with a nice bed.i would have rated this 'good' if we had not paid so much for the room. great view, small room (to be expected in a city), horrible service. unfortunately it seems the staff means well but they just don't get what it takes to be a 4 star hotel. simple things like pulling our car down from valet was an epic fail, 40 minutes? it is one thing to pay a high rate at a hotel with excellent service, it is quite another to be disappointed consistently over a 2 night stay in a suite at the w. will not be back.two positives, nice gym and complimentary coffee/continental breakfast in the morning.i am still angry about the recent stay at this location . i travel twice per month for business ;however, this trip was personal . i have no idea why they label a service what ever , when ever !after my boyfriend prepaid the room and i checked in early providing my credit card for the early check in . my boyfriend did suggest to me that i should be sure that my card would not be charged and only a resource for incidental purposes . big mistake .i actually called down to see if there was a place to purchase a razor and was informed that the w would be happy to provide one . needless to say 2 hours later and three phone calls later the razor arrived with a angry staff member that delivered the razor .not to mention we were in what they considered a room with a city view . the only view we had was of the building directly in front of the w . the room was small and the decor seemed a bit out dated . the shower floor was not cleaned well .in addition :my boyfriend and i did order room service that was paid for when delivered . two days after we check out i received a alert for charges to my credit card . 19 dollars for a 10 minute local phone call and 119. for something that has yet to be explained .i have attempted to contact everyone at the hotel as well as my boyfriend attempting to figure out why they charged us both for the same things ...i now can only assume that this is like the razor , when ever they get ready to do something .i stay all over the us and more than i care to ;however, i expect 5* customer service as that is what is being payed for in such a hotel . i will never stay at the w againfirst i would agree with otgers that the rooms are way too dark... the ambience is fun for about 5 minutes and then you try to get ready to go out and you run into trouble. we opened our blinds fully to get more light in the room but the outside of the windows were so grimy and dirty it ruined the view entirely.we ordered room service on our last day and i have never had such terrible food served to me. my husband and i enjoyed fine dining all weekend in atlanta but i would rather have eaten at an ihop. my husbands eggs were almost entirely raw, the whites were nowhere close to cooked and my waffle seems to have been precooked and was so stale and dry i couldnt eat it.it was a very disappointing end to our stay. i will say the bartenders were exceptional... very friendly and professional. tgey made wonderful recommendations and pairings. i would recommend the bar to anyone.lets start off with saying the only parking arrangement at the hotel is valet and while that typically is not an issue, the valet service is sub-par at best.. when the valet took my keys they put the incorrect color code on my vehicle because they were so involved in the conversation they were having about some womans behind they could not be bothered with my service. after doing this they did not ask me anything about my stay what so ever and just said they will take care of it and took off before i even had a chance to get everything out of my car. after checking in, we had to have the valet retrieve my car so i could finish unloading. we finally get to our room and it is quite possibly the tiniest room i have ever stayed in, the lighting was terrible, it felt like it was trying too hard to be swanky and just missed the mark entirely. later when we decided to go out to dinner we again requested my car from valet and was promptly asked for a $15 fee. when i asked why we were being charged $15 the woman at the valet said it was because we were not over night guests. when i informed her we were in fact over night guests she said i had the wrong color code on my keys and asked me why i would have the wrong color code on my keys when i was an over night guests. i quickly informed her i was not an employee of the w hotel downtown and that i was not the person she should be asking questions too. when she got her manager he came to me and again asked why i had the incorrect color code, when i went into my explanation of the earlier mishap with the valet he turned to my spouse and as if i had not been speaking english and asked him what the issue was, while i understand he may have had a hard time with this conversation due to the fact that the staff smelled strongly of marijuana and was drinking at the valet stand, which was highly inappropriate, there was no issue with my english nor with my enunciation. after i informed the manager i was the person he needed to speak to if he did not understand what was happening and i am the one who dealt with the valet to begin with he acted like i was not important. after 15 minutes of conversation that seemed to be going no where he finally correct my key. the next day we check out and are on our 6 hour drive back to our home in fl while checking the bank account i notice there are two charges for valet on my credit card. after calling and having this corrected for the second time up pops up another charge for $8 bag of gummy bears that we did not eat. after informing them we did not eat the gummy bears nor did we partake in the graciously displayed complimentary\" bottle of nestle purelife water they so kindly leave for you in the corner of the room, or the shampoo, conditioner and body wash that was available free of charge in the shower, why on earth would i eat a handful of $8 gummy bears? for the amount this hotel charges to stay in their poorly unorganized gaudily decorated hotel you would think the staff and managers would not be so aloof about their job. this hotel is not cool nor would i consider it luxury as i can get better service and accommodations at an hourly motel that i did at this terrible excuse for a hotel.\"don't get me wrong, i like boutique hotels. i really like them. but the w takes this trendy, too-cool-for-school aura too far. music is too loud everywhere, the staff is too casual for a hotel in this price range. no free internet in the rooms (what??? ) . complimentary coffee service in the living room\" is served in cardboard cups. (the hampton inn provides mugs). the good thing is it's only one night. did i mention the staff? except for the valet guys, people did a lot of looking down their noses at us.\"terrific location, comfortable bed, good food, and rooms that are dark, even in the middle of the day. this hotel is definitely designed to appeal to younger people with a need to be trendy. the problem with trendy is that it looks outdated after about two years. the staff are wonderful and responsive, and this is a great hotel if you can get past having a glass shower in the bedroom, the equivalent of 15 watt lights throughout the room, and slooooow elevators. 2 to 3 minute waits are not unusual during busy times like mornings, evenings, and checkout time.your first clue that the rooms are unusual is the lack of room pictures on the website. you mostly find close-ups of the sink. what is it they don‚äôt want you to see? i can see where the young, trendy crowd might overlook some of the drawbacks (bring a flat bill hat so you can fit in), but the seasoned business traveler will be disappointed.one small oddity ‚äì don‚äôt bother using the stairs if you are on a lower floor. for security purposes, the only exit is an alarmed (presumably exterior) door at street level. you‚äôll end up walking back up to the 5th floor and waiting for the elevator to the lobby.that said, the convention and meeting rooms are nice (and bright!) and comfortable. just don't try to get there by the stairs.my wife and i were staying for labor day weekend. we cut the trip short. service needs to improve anyways but how they treated the guests at the pool at 8pm was ridicoulous. we were enjoying a few drinks enjoying the dj when at 8 pm the staff kicked everyone out of the pool. they were having a hotel party but lots of people that were not staying at the hotel. when their party was over our stay at the pool was cut short. we then were abruptly kicked out of the pool. let's just say that we had two more days but checked out that day.i'm currently staying at this hotel and it appears to be run by teenagers. it is currently, as i type this, approximately a 15 minute wait for an elevator. a patron in heels asked if a stair case could be opened up (keep in mind most rooms are at least 10 stories up). apparently they are not allowed to open the stairwell per the fire marshal. never heard of such a rule. do i get to use the stair if there is a fire?there is one young woman at the desk who only smiles and apologizes. i asked to speak to a manager and she said she was the only one available right now. really . . . one person . . . and no manager. you should see the lobby right now . . . it's mayhem.i have stayed at starwood properties all over the country and typically have good experiences. however, there are too many other companies paying more attention and getting it right. no need for me to play games here at the w-downtown atlanta.if you prefer a lack of service and don't have a schedule of your own to keep, please stay here. otherwise, you might want to visit a more professional property around the corner.starwood corporate . . . please send an adult to fix this place!we stayed at the w for 4 nights while attending a convention. the hotel was packed full, but their service remained excellent.in particular, carly at the front desk was an absolute joy. whenever we saw her, she cheerfully greeted us. on the few occasions we made a request, not only did she remember our room number, but it was all handled without the least effort on our part.their valet was also very friendly and helpful.the hotel is clean, and has a very upbeat and modern vibe.in summary, carly's level of service and friendliness was reminisce of our recent stays at the disney resorts! that says it all.bravo!there were 63 items for sale in my room. not kidding, i counted because i found it so offensive. valet parking is the only parking available, $30/night. internet, you pay per night, and it's terrible. you have to sign something on check-in that you wont bring outside alcohol into the room (presumably so you'll buy theirs). everything is an upcharge.the concierge was helpful enough, but not nearly what i'd expect from a hotel with this type of pricetag. valet parking took a while, but the staff was upbeat about it.now, to the ambiance. the entire hotel room looked like somewhere to have an illicit affair. purple walls, large backlit panels, a floor lamp that throws designs onto the walls and ceiling, a low couch with martini glasses strategically set next to it, furry purple throws on the end of the beds...and condoms for sale over the mini-bar. yep. oh, and frosted glass: let's talk about that: one of our rooms had two queens in it--and a frosted glass wall backlit from the bathroom side--into the shower. great if you're that kind of foursome... less great if you're just friends. the king room had a clear glass wall into the shower, and no door to the shower-- not a whole lot of privacy, even for a couple.i cant argue that the hotel wasn't high end, but i left feeling slightly cheapened, and not at all luxurious. next time, we'll stay at the westin.much better value to be had at other nearby hotels. we paid roughly double what our business colleagues paid at other high-end hotels within steps of w. purple paint is nice and all, but will never choose w again. we upgraded our room to the fantastic\" or whatever, but it was small. less than 2 feet of space between the beds. \"2 free cocktails ... not with your package.\" \"complimentary breakfast ... not with your package.\" \"unhappy with the value ... i'm sorry you feel that way (sent in an email).\"save your money! stay elsewhere.\"stayed here for one evening on work. the room was clean and very modern. we did eat at the blt restaurant downstairs, but would not recommend. aside from that, the room was nice. might not be good for roommates as you can see shower.this place just didn't do anything for me. upon entering the place you do not feel welcome at all. the attendants are stuffy and luke warm and the reception is even cooler. now, i know i am not urban hipster\" but come on....the halls are dark and dusty. coffee service is inconsistent in the hallway and paint chipping everywhere in the room and the roman shades outdated and barely worked. the linens felt like sand paper. room service, don't even bother. the food was really bad. the valet wanted me to pay them personally...i don't think so. very unprofessional! so glad i got that out of my system. too many other properties around the area that would have much better customer service and a nicer property.\"i recently stayed at the w hotel in atlanta for 5 nights. i paid an average of $245/night and was very disappointed in my stay.the hotel is a design hotel, but it needs a little spiffing up. a lot of the glass and metal were dusty and fingerprinted which detracted from the overall appearance.the rooms are painted charcoal grey and deep magenta in the bathroom. it hides some of the dirt - my curtains were badly stained (see photo) and the paint in the toilet room had a lot of stains on it as well. the shower didn't drain (see photo) and one of my lights didn't work.i complained to the management and the light was addressed immediately. the shower and the curtains remained an issue and it wasn't until day 4 of my stay that they offered to buy me drinks or breakfast to make it up to me.in addition, it the w is a party\" hotel - the w provides ear plugs to guests - and for 2 of my nights i listened to loud parties until 3 am.the location is only medium - it is downtown near the freeway and two blocks (that are parking lots) from the fun part of downtown. you can definitely do better in atlanta.there is free wifi only in the lounge - you pay in your room - and the overall hotel experience was not good. i was looking for an adjustment to my bill given the issues i experienced, but i was ignored.i expected better of the w, but clearly this is not a luxury hotel.\"stayed two nights @w.the first things we saw on our arrival to the room was it was small wonderful room.it hadn't been dusted in a while.even the bottle of fiji water was dusty.there was everything for sale from condoms to umbrella's in the room.all i can say is this isn't a family friendly hotel.the shower stall had mold on the walls. and on the first night starting @ 10:30 pm-3am there was lough screaming,slamming of doors that our door would shake.of course we complained&the young lady @ the desk commented they were regulars & she never knew they acted like that.we told her that's no excuse because they are regulars,are you staying in the room with them to know what they do,once they check in?the acura service is drop off only.kudo's to the driver frank,he was very knowlegeable & helpful.parking is $30 day.if we choose to stay @w again it will not be in a wonderful room.also, we were on the 14th floor & the street noise was distracting until we started to tune it out. and i have to agree it is dark from elevator, hallways, & room.i attended a party here for nye. a friend of mine rented a fairly large two bedroom suite on the 15th floor. the style of the hotel is either love it or hate it, and i fall in the second category. i like modern and clean, but the style of this w is very bling, and more for the kardhasian wanna-be types. it will probably need a refresh fairly soon. what i took issue with was the fact that the suite my friend paid for should not have been rented out that night. their was a leak in the ceiling at one point near the dining area. the ceiling was not repaired properly, nor was the wood flooring, which was buckled in the dining area. i am surprised that the flooring was not replaced because it really is a trip hazard. also, the air vents in the bathrooms, especially in the guest bath, were black with dust, and needed to be cleaned. what else was surprising was how small the tv's were. the living-room is huge, and the wall the tv is on is tremendous. it could have easily fit a 60 inch tv, but it looks like there is barely a 37 inch there.the best part of the suite was the huge bathroom in the main bedrooms, complete with an impressive soaking tub. the only suggestion there would be to frost the glass door where the toilet is, since the bathroom is open. that could be a little awkward if you want privacy.stayed here for business during the sec. the lobby gets very loud with music and people during the evening. the staff at the front are very friendly. the room is dark, but very modern and comfortable. the beds were great and the bathroom was roomy with lots of shelves. the room was very quiet. plenty of outlets for your electronics. 2 things that bothered me, the valet was extremely rude. i had to call each morning for my car and was not greeted warmly. they were not polite and rarely moved with speed. even after calling down, waiting 5 minutes, then making my way over to valet, they were sitting in their room and had not even begun to get my car. when i pulled back up to valet in the evening, i was rarely greeted and had to wait or get out of my car to find someone. the towels in the bathroom smelled horrible!! i don't know what they use to wash them but i had to hold my breath to dry off. this needs to be fixed.i really wanted to like this place, i really did. it all started off so well. pleasant check in, sleek modern hotel, great room, great bathroom. at check in, we were granted free in room wifi, i think because we decided to have room keeping every other day instead of every day. hotel gym was great, roof top pool awesome, and beds were comfortable. here was the incident:we stayed in the hotel from wed-sun. on thursday night, we heard a woman screaming (seriously screaming) in pretty late at night, maybe 1am. it woke up my friend and myself from a dead sleep, but we fell back asleep, so no problem. friday night, i returned to the hotel around 3:30am, i was trying to be quiet so as to be respectful of the other guests, no need as it turns it. the guests directly across from me were still carrying on, slamming doors, laughing, running up and down the hallways, yelling (it was not only the room directly across, but also 2 or 3 other rooms next to it). so, i let this go until about 4am, at which point, i thought, this is riduculous. i called the front desk to complain, she said she would send security up to resolve, but honestly, she sort of gave me the impression i was bothering her. nothing got resolved until 5:30, when i guess they finally fell asleep, or passed out. ridiculous. no offense, but if i'm spending $200 a night, i want to be able to sleep, call me demanding.the next afternoon when i finally woke up, i went downstairs to speak with the manager. she mentioned there was no note of any incidents or anyone calling the night before; this might explain why my neighbors were allowed to carry on until 5:30 am, security was never called. in all fairness to the manager, she really did rectify the situation. i specifically asked if those people had checked out, otherwise i knew i'd have the same issue; they hadn't. she moved us to a different floor, corner room, and even gave us a discount on that night. when we checked out the next day, the girl mentioned the w\" brand of hotels is sort of known for this, as if it were a party hotel. i'm fine with this, i didn't get back to my room until 3:30am anyway, but 5:30?? seriously??? sorry, i'll never stay in a w hotel again. very nice hotels, but never again. in addition to the \"incident\", i just didn't really care for the other guests i saw there either, it really seems like a place to go to the club (there's one right inside the hotel), get sloshed, be obnoxious, and just stay in the hotel! no thanks.\"had a couple of nights here last weekend.check-in. easy enough. valet parking. straightfordward process.rooms: a little quirky and modern. but, no real complaints. everything was new. the shower kinda sits in the middle of the room.bars: 2nd floor bar was reasonably busy. bar tenders were good and fast. there's also a bar at the 16th floor pool. i drank here before i got busy and apparently it gets very busy.gym: excellent. lots of equipment. awesome view of downtown.pool: major disappointment. its outside but covered (to allow pool parties in the rain), meaning the sun skirts around the outside of the roof, so no complete sun coverage throughout the day. it's also very small and a limited number of beds.internet: you pay for it ($15) and it's extremely low, which adds insult to injury.major issue i had was the valet team losing the keys to my rental car. low and behold they were found an hour late by which time i had a pick-up truck on the way from hertz and had already phoned in to report incident to hertz. valet was extremely apologetic but this isn't the type of thing you would expect. put a dampener on the whole trip.i will start out by saying that the staff who were there did a great job under terrible conditions. i feel for them and admire their positivity.that said it is clear that this property has two big issues: the actual building itself which has a terrible entrance ( police are stationed there due to the poor traffic engineering), small rooms, has too little elevator capacity , has windows that don't block the noise from the adjacent highway, etc.the second issue is that senior management has no idea how to staff . i had to wait five minutes to pull in as the valet service was under staffed. there was no greeter to tell me where to go as the bell service was understaffed. at prime check in time the poor gal behind the counter was swamped with check ins,phone calls and inquiries. the restaurant for both dinner and breakfast were slow and overwhlemed by volume....i walked out after 10 minutes on the former, and had to go back into the kitchen on the latter to see where things stood.again, staff tried but were set up to fail....there are much better options in this marketwhat a weird hotel! everything about it is clean, upscale, etc. but, it's a party hotel appealing to a certain type--young people looking to hook-up. we went for a family get-away and couldn't go to the pool because of private parties. rooms were noisy because of the parties too. very disappointing and won't stay here again. plus, $30 valet parking and very dark vibe to rooms.not for families!!!! do not take your kids to this establishment......i explored the website prior to booking and thought it would be a fun hotel for the kids to experience while in atlanta, they were so excited to stay there and could not wait to use the pool.....no where on the site does it say that it is not a kid friendly hotel....and it should! we checked in around 9pm, after the braves baseball game was over. our plans were to check in and hit the pool. the hotel was more like a night club and we felt like we needed to lock ourselves in the hotel room. the front desk assistant told us that there was a party at the pool and it would probably not be appropriate for our children until first thing in the morning, which totally defeated our reason for staying there in the first place. my children were harassed and accosted by drunk party goers while on the elevator going up to our room. we decided to check out the pool since this was one of our main reasons for booking this hotel. we were stopped by a security guard who told us that it was not appropriate for our family to be in the pool area. he took our room number and notified the front desk. they offered to compensate us with a free movie, melted ice cream and stale popcorn. this was an awful experience and i will never stay at another hotel like this with my family. they should be ashamed and somewhere on the website it needs to specifically say that it is not a family friendly environment. we spent a lot of money and splurged on something we thought would be an enjoyable experience, unfortunately it was the opposite and i am ashamed that we ever took our kids into that establishment.i am very angry that of all w establishments this one the rooms where not as sanitary. i wish they up keep the rooms. other wise w's are great. this one i was not fully satisfiedi have stayed at this property for over 5 nights each on two occasions now because of the proximity of my work visit. i travel alot and initally found the design of the property to be cool\" but it is designed for a young party crowd and not condusive for business travel. the property is depressing, dark lobby, bar, dark uninviting halls, elevators and rooms. even with all of the lights on bright in the rooms you have to put your paper under a lamp to read anything. the charcol grey tiles, floors, walls and utilitarian furniture and design feel like your staying in a dark stylized prison cell. while the staff at the reception \"pods\" and ground level areas are friendly, the service pretty much stops there. i had asked for a coffee maker upon check in only to be told that they would ask but were all spoken for. when asked the next day, i was told i would be put on a list but could go 9 floors down to make my own cup of coffe at a table set up in the hall. tired of that option, i ordered coffee and a muffin the next day from room service only to find that the order had never been picked up off the door. now getting dressed to go down stairs again to make my own cup of coffee, i found that all of the supplies to do it were gone. i then found someone to replenish the coffee table and was told it would be a few minutes. i went back up 9 flights of stairs to get my own water for the coffee maker and went down to make the coffee. later that night upon returning to the room i asked again for a coffee maker and was told they had one and it would be sent to the room. an hour later, i called again to place a room service order for dinner and asked about the coffee maker again. i was told once again it was on it's way. i called after another hour passed, this time it was 11:30 and was appoligized to when the coffee maker still was not there and asked when my dinner was going to arrive as it had been over an hour since ordering. i was told the kitchen was backed up and that the dinner would be comped by the hotel. the coffe maker showed up over 3 hours since it's request and my dinner showed up at 12:15 a.m. almost 2 hours after ordering it. upon inspection of the dinner, two of the items asked for were missing from the tray. the next morning, i woke up and made a cup of coffee only to find that the unit did not work!!! imagine my agrivation. on top of all of this the bed is very uncomfortable, the bedding does not stay around the platform matress and the only chair to sit in is an armless desk chair or low leather like covered hard bench/chaise with low arm and back. two nights upon returning to the room, i found the maid had not replaced the towels and had to ask for more towels. the counters were not wiped down and the ice bucket not emptied out. even during the day, it was hard to get enough light in the room with the film on the windows and you had to stand on the chaise to get to the roman shades open and closed. the night before checking out i walked across the streed and made reservation for my next business trip to the area so i would not be forced to take the only option. this property is also a residential tower that had not been able to sell units but that does not give the hotel the excuse to not live up to the w standards. signed, jonathan marquardt, disappointed guest. had i not been required to prepay for my visit and there were other hotels with availability, i would have moved.\"typical w......with funky decor and hip cool themes......rooms are tiny.....and in keeping with ws around the world, extra charges for everything but tap water......it was a fun 1 night stay for us to go see journey concert.....wouldn't pick w for longer stays....much more sensible (for longer stays) to pick something like hampton inn where they'll put coffee maker in room and over breakfast.....my friends and i stayed at the w downtown atlanta for our college reunion. as a starwoods preferred member, i chose this hotel as the w hotels have a great reputation. this hotel is beautifully designed and the rooms are a nice size. i was initially impressed with the service on our day of arrival. they surprised me and sent a microwave up to my room when i wanted to reheat food. the second night of our stay is when the service was noted to deteriorate. our room was not cleaned properly and housekeeping management ended up having to reclean the room. when we requested an extra robe, a robe with blood on the back was brought to us. we complained to management who ended up refunding a portion of our daily parking fees. management was also suppose to double my starwoods points but failed to do so even after the promise was placed in writing. i have stayed at many starwoods hotels and have been pleased up until this point. i was overall disappointed with this w hotel and will likely not stay at it again or recommend it.this hotel seems to be a good case study at how to make something that looks rather pretty but doesn't work very well. take the bathroom: the sink is a 'modern' design, but incredibly awkward to use. turn on the flow of water too high and it hits the drain and splashes up at you. the bottom of the sink is flat, so it drains poorly and there's probably a hair or two from a previous occupant of the room sitting in there. in addition there's likely some toothpaste on the outside edge of the sink, because a poorly placed towel rack means you have to lean in way too far to use it.run out of toilet paper? the spare roll is sitting on top of the toilet in this cute but very tight bag. the problem is that you have to fight to extract the roll from the clutches of the bag, which is probably the last thing you want to be doing when you need some extra tp.the bed was comfortable, though the duvet had an oddly plastic feel and some stains of an origin that i wasn't interested in pondering. as others have written, the room's walls are a dark purple color which will force you to use every light switch in the room. even with every light on and each dimmer switch at the maximum, reading will still be difficult.there are way too many shiny surfaces in the room, making fingerprints and any other unknown smeared substances on the surface very obvious. i realize that other people have used the room before i rented it, but i can't ever recall being in a hotel room which brought such obvious attention to this fact through its choice of furniture and decoration. housekeeping definitely needs a far greater attention to detail.the $14.95 internet connection was slow. there was a more expensive $19.95 option, which i assume was faster, but there was no obvious explanation of the service levels and i thought $14.95 was costly enough. the connection runs for 24 hours and not the noon to noon\" schedule which is listed in all of the hotel literature. free wifi is available in the \"living room\" off of the cramped lobby, and it's full of more furniture that looks nice but isn't terribly comfortable to use. the room's tv was an hdtv with an odd mix of analog and hd content.there's not a lot of interest in the immediate vicinity of the property, but there is a decent restaurant at the hotel, a pizza place across the street, and a marta station (\"civic center\") a little further beyond that.this hotel was certainly unique, but for me it was a uniqueness that i found to be quite undesirable. better housekeeping could certainly improve the experience.\"i had really expected the w to be a nice hotel but was shortly disappointed. the room was quite small and cramped. you could hear people talking and coughing in the adjacent rooms. there was no free internet access. if you want internet, expect to pay $20/day for it. they offer the typical temptations in the room, but the prices were unreal. unless you're drunk or something, who pays $10 for m&m's or $8 for bottled water. the decor was nice but that is about all i have positive to say about the place. some of the staff was nice, some were not so nice. if you have money to burn or are impressed with names, stay here.it is a beautiful hotel, and within walking distance of the aquarium and the coke factory. that is pretty much the only good things i can say about it. the service was horrible. the concierge could never be found, the room service was terrible, and the valet staff were extremely rude. both nights we were there, the people next door came back to their room at 3 am with friends, and proceeded to play loud music and talk loudly until 9 am. when we called to the front desk to resolve the situation after knocking on the door resolved nothing, we were told that they couldn't do anything\" and that we \"would just have to go back to sleep.\" i will never stay in a w hotel again.\"the w in downtown atlanta caters to a narrow demographic. the hotel boasts black hallways, muted gray carpet, and dark purple walls in their rooms and lamps lit with flashlight bulbs. it has a very swankya nd very club like atmosphere. the purple leather-like lounge in our room was handy to hold the suitcase - but not for kicking back and reading or watching tv. there was no reading the book i brought anyway- since the dark walls sucked up what little light came from the very strange lamp in the room. our personal verizon wifi picked up only when the laptop was propped up against the window tho i am sure the hotel wifi - at $$ a day picked up great. the bed was luxuriously soft\" so much so that we and our fellow travelers felt twinges from bad backs for three days. i can see how \"twenty-somethings\" might love this hotel. it is not for families or mature travelers. the valet parking was $30 a day, in this part of atlanta, even at that price - it was worth it to us. as for cleanliness of the hotel, who knows - it is too dark to see...what was easy to see was the vast collection of hotel items for sale in the room. the fridge is chock-full of stuff to buy and there were bottles of wine, whiskey, water,and vodka as well as candy, mints, gum umbrellas, t-shirts, candy and condoms. not a good idea for people traveling with children...you will either love this hotel or hate it.\"this past weekend my husband and i stayed at the w hotel downtown atlanta. to say that it was a disappointment wouldn't even come close to putting it into words. when we walked in the lobby the music was blaring and banging like a teenager's car, and we are not old!!!! imagine our surprise to head to the spa and see non-guests of the hotel headed to the pool after paying a cover charge. the offensive music was pumping at the pool and could be heard in the spa where one is supposed to go to calm down. the guest room was so dark, even with all the lights on it was difficult to see. we went downstairs to eat the blt steakhouse which was pretty good and the staff was nice so that calmed us down some. we finished dinner and were told that the acura would be right back to take us to our show at the fox. we waited in the living room and as we were asked to do and watched as the acura pulled in and another couple was put in the acura and taken off to the next destination. the conceirge didn't even get up to apologize we had to go to her. now with 15 minutes to show time we had to catch a taxi because at the w downtown there is only one acura and apparently whenever, wherever\" is only for a very select few guests of the hotel. the conceirge did give us her card though and said to call the number when the show was over and the acura would pick us up. we hailed a taxi and made it to the show on time. after the show when we called we were told that the driver had already gone home for the day and the conceirge should not have promised us a ride and that it was not their problem. we hailed another taxi back to the hotel and headed to our room. we were awakened at midnight to the staff vacuuming the halls and it lasted a good hour before they stopped. who vacuums at midnight??? i would not recommend the hotel to anyone and will make sure that everyone knows that it is more of night club then a hotel. maybe this was the goal though since it is advertised as \"chic\". whatever that is supposed to mean. i can tell you one thing it is though and that is overpriced and overrated.\"the w is trendy and very nice. the room really is amazing mainly because it is so different from your average hotel room. the staff were all friendly and i don't have anything bad to say about the hotel. however i do think you pay a lot of the ambience as there are not many extras included.i tried to find somewhere outside the hotel for breakfast on saturday morning, but i walked a 3 block radius and could not find anything. i ended up back at the w express cafe which is really just the blt restaurant to go. i got 2 bagels with cream cheese and 2 orange juices for $25. the same menu is available for room service as well.as much as those prices irritated me, i guess you don't come to a luxury hotel in downtown atlanta and expect low prices.again the w is very nice and i had no complaints.i have spent thousands of nights in hotel rooms of one type or another over the years, but this place was one of me more unusual properties i've ever visited. like other reviews on this site i found the rooms dark beyond words - there was not enough light to read the complimentary paper that i received on one day, but not the other. the exposed shower/tub that other posters mentioned was indeed very disconcerting. i avoided the extensive array of items for sale in the room, but did have to pay $2.00 for a travel-sized bottle of hairspray, which was available from the front desk. my room had three different maintenance issues that were addressed by three different technicians in three different visits. my request to replace the heavy duvet with it‚äôs unpleasant feeling cover required four phone calls in one day. they brought me a twin-sized comforter that had been washed so often that it was noticeably faded, but extremely soft. too bad i was sleeping in a queen-sized bed.connected with my job duties, which meant spending considerable time in the lobby, i found the front desk staff to be polite and helpful, but was confused in recognizing exactly who were the staff members since they were fashionable dressed young people who were not in uniform nor wearing any type of name badges or other identifying insignia and were constantly shifting positions and duties.the blt restaurant food quality was good enough but expensive and did indeed have a limited menu. they also provide the room service for the hotel. a room service hamburger with fries costs $28.00 with tax and delivery fee included in that total. it did come with a fancy cover over the plate though. if the mellow mushroom restaurant next door had still been open at that late hour, i would have dined there.the location of the w is on the outer fringes of downtown. i walked to the hyatt on a couple of occasions as well as to the georgia aquarium. being from florida, the hills were a bit of a challenge, but i never felt unsafe on the streets. the marta station is only 5 minutes walk from the hotel and was very convenient for moving around the city and accessing the airport.i can see the appeal of this type of hotel to a certain demographic, but personally i would not visit again.hotel check in process confusing, our credit card was held for a group room....even though the rooms were already paid for. every room (like 20 rooms) had alcohol in it....not what you want around with kids/teens traveling with a chaperone. when we asked to have it removed, we were told there would be a $50.00 per room fee to remove, and they already removed the intimacy kits\", considering they knew the rooms were for kids/teens i guess we should have said \"thank you for that\" their attitude was it was \"our\" problem and the desk clerk said, \"well we assumed the kids/would be chaperoned.\" my answer was, \" suppose some crafty teen gets into the alcohol and consumes it, who is responsible...the room is on my credit card and its your hotel?\" he checked with somebody in the back and agreed to remove it from the 2 rooms our credit card was held hostage for. the rest of the rooms were finally resolved after the tour company got involved. i was just amazed that the hotel would want to take that risk. they could have refused our tour, but once again they wanted our money. the final straw came at checkout. we were charged for 3 nights valet parking even though we didn't have a car, we took marta to the hotel (they offer no transportation either). they would not correct that at the desk, even though we were standing there holding our boarding passes for our airline. they needed to investigate what happened? really, we don't have a car, what would we need valet for? pretty simple to me. that took 2 weeks to get resolved, but again was finally corrected. just not sure it is worth the hassle. they offered no compensation and no apologies, just acted like they were doing us a favor of correcting our bill which they screwed up. the acura transportation was a joke, no way could they keep up with all of the guests with just that one car.....luckily, we could walk or take the marta.\"please read before booking this hotel! this is a fair and honest review with nothing but facts. i booked my stay through hotels.com for 2 nights. i called the hotel 2 days before arrival to make sure that my room type (2 queen beds) and non smoking preference would be honored. as many travelers know it is not guaranteed when booking with other sites not directly affiliated with the hotel. when i called the w i was told that it would not be a problem to honor my request. when i arrived i checked in and was escorted by the bellman to my room. the room was incorrect. i was placed in a king bed room on a smoking floor. the bellman directed us to stay in the room and he would go to the front desk and get our ‚äúnew room keys‚äù. after 15 minutes the man returned and stated that i would need to go back to the front desk as there was ‚äúa problem‚äù. i traveled again with all of our luggage back downstairs to the front desk and the young lady who checked us in acted as if she knew nothing about the situation. i explained to her the reservation and handed her my confirmation which stated my room type and smoking preference. she told me that since i did not book directly through the w hotel that they were unable to guarantee my room. i explained to her that i had called and this was not to be a problem. she left me at the desk for about 5 minutes to speak with her manager‚ä¶who never bothered to come out and speak to us himself. she walked out of the office and handed me my reservation paper and stated that they would basically do me a favor this time but that i need to read my reservation papers better. she had a patronizing attitude and was exteremly rude. when we arrived in our room the light in the hallway was burned out and the shower liner was mildewed . we decided that we would try to make the best of it. we had a lovely dinner at blt restaurant and did sleep well in the comfortable beds. the next day we went to the front desk to ask for walking directions to the atlanta civic center ( fabulous dianna exhibit) we were told ‚äú i am not sure we don‚äôt have many guests that would go there.‚äù again attitude! they acted as if it was beneath them to offer such directions. btw the civic center is 5 blocks from the hotel. i find it hard to believe that they did not know how to get there. we were gone from our room from 9 am until 450 pm. we arrived back to a dirty room. when i inquired at the front desk about the room (trash overflowing, no clean sheets etc.) i was told that they ‚äústyled rooms from 7-5 and that they would get to my room when they could. attitude! that was it‚ä¶i asked to speak to the manager. he informed me by phone that he would be up to my room in 10-15 minutes‚ä¶..one hour later after a second call to the front desk‚ä¶the manager arrived and basically offered no apologizes for the staff or the condition of the room. what he did offer was this ‚ä¶.‚äùwe are at 98% occupancy and we are doing the best we can do. since you booked at hotels.com we guarantee nothing to you but a room. after much excuses and debates (everyone at this hotel is argumentative) he offered us free in room dining , a movie on the tv and a drink at the hotel bar while our room was being styled. after the room was cleaned i was told to pick up the phone and call for the in room dining. guess what? the phone was magically not working. i had to use my cell phone and call the front desk. i was told that they would have ‚äúengineering‚äù come fix the phone ( they never came‚ä¶big surprise) i was also told by the front desk that they knew my meal was being given to me free and what can we get you. attitude‚ä¶..i mean do they not do any training on how to speak to guests? the food arrived and it was good (from blt) the new shower liner was hung, but it was about 4 inches to short and water was all over the floor. i could go on and on about the comments made by hotel staff. they are basically not well trained and rude. i called hotels.com and was placed on hold while they called the hotel. when the lady from hotels.com came back on the line she stated ‚äúwow they are rude.‚äù‚ä¶.so i guess it is just the w way.they have a saying at the w‚ä¶whatever whenever‚ä¶this applies to the staff and not the guest. it means whatever the hotel feels like providing you with and whenever they feel like doing it. i have traveled all over the world and stayed in hotels that were far less expensive than this with much better service. i felt like i was in the twilight zone‚ä¶this hotel just does not get it‚ä¶..they have zero customer service. i have never been so ready to check out of a hotel in my life. btw the movie was on our bill‚ä¶‚ä¶so much for honoring the compthe first shock is when you enter the dark cave that is the lobby. the first assumption is that you are in the garage valet parking desk. unfortuantely, the dark disco scene is found throughout the hotel. imagine sleeping in an abercrombies with the blaring music.then comes the room... if you are traveling on business and sharing a room with another person, you might want to be aware that you are on view through a glass wall into the bedroom as you shower. awkward.i loved the the flat screened tv but the extras like condoms and lube made me glad i wasn't on a family vacation. i loved the westin bed but definitely will limit my westin bed experiences in the future to a regular westin - not a w!!!for dinner we tried blt. ok but definetly not the best in atlanta in its price range.i'm not sure what this hotel is trying to be but i was very dissapointed. rude, arrogant staff.. dark, dreary and depressing... it made me feel dirty.try to imagine the le parker meridian in new york if it were being run as a bordello. any attempt to create a cool atmosphere like the la parker meridan is ruined by the sleazy dark excesses that are the w in downtown atlanta. never again.my sister and i travelled on a two-week driving trip from st. louis to atlanta. we spent two nights in atlanta -- the friday and saturday of labor day weekend. although i made hotel bookings in late june, rooms in atlanta were almost impossible to come by -- i did not realize that there would be a huge college football game, plus a nascar event, plus an international comic book convention, plus gay pride. no hotel website had anything to offer, but booking.com had one thing available: a room at the w for $559 per night. i booked it. we arrived at 9:30 p.m. on friday night to hear loud pop music blaring out the front door and all through the lobby and elevators. though we had booked for two nights, they could give us a room with two beds for only one night, and said they would move us to a room with a single king bed for the second night. my sister and i were not pleased, but we went to our room. it was dark and cramped, and i could not believe they were charging $559 for it. the room had very trendy modern light fixtures that did not emit enough light to read by. there was one reading\" light between the two beds -- which allowed reading only of giant type. no business person would ever stay in such a room -- impossible to read a document of any kind. bathroom door did not fully close. sheets were starched severely so that they made noise when you made the slightest movement. the next morning i was able to find a room at the hampton inn at the airport, and we checked out of the w. i was presented with a bill for $649 -- $90 more than i was quoted when i made the reservation. a few days later, i received my credit card bill showing that they had charged me an additional $81 for snacks. i went through the roof. we had not eaten or drunk anything in the room. after three phone calls to the hotel, they credited my credit card account for the disputed amount. and then i checked the w website and found that the normal price for our room was $306. i don't know who did the price gouging -- whether it was the hotel or the booking website -- but i will never stay again at a w hotel.\"i have stayed at numerous w hotels and loved each and every stay. based upon this experience, i decided to take my family on a short weekend staycation\" in downtown atlanta. my children are 9 and 6 and are well traveled, including multiple w stays.our check-in went smootly and as a spg gold member i was upgraded to a higher floor. the room was nicely appointed, but with a quirky lay-out that did not utilize space in an efficient manner. we immediately headed to the pool as it is on the 16th floor and has a great view of the surrounding area. we had difficulty finding seats at first as the pool and surrounding bar was crowded. after finally settling in we discovered one reason for the crowds when we talked to our pool neighbors who lived close by. apparently in an effort to increase pool bar revenue, the hotel has put word out that locals can enjoy the pool as well. interesting decision and might explain why our food order took 45 minutes.we enjoyed a very enjoyable dinner at blt steak that evening and thought their service was impecable. unfortunately, that was the last customer service we received.upon returning to the room, we called their self proclaimed, \"whatever, whenever\" line to request an extra blanket for my son who was going to sleep on the chaise lounge. the gentlemen said he would send them up and we waited 45 minutes with no response. i called back to now be told that the hotel did not have extra blankets. i am still not sure what was more troubling, a hotel not having extra blankets or the non-apologetic manner in which the message was conveyed. i was clearly an annoyance to this person.upon going to sleep, we were awoken no less than 4 times that evening with crowds of partiers carrying on in the halls. most of the disturbances were brief, but one involved a 5 minute dispute between rooms that included profanity and slammed doors. i say this less than because i was offended, but as a warning, to those that are seeking a quiet getaway. the economy has made this hotel affordable and in doing so attracked a younger and less refined clientele.the next morning, i called down as a gold spg member to get a late check-out so we could enjoy some downtown activities and perhaps finish with a swim. once again the \"whatever, whenever\" line quickly told me that they do not offer late check-outs. after explaining to her that as a gold member i have the option of a 4:00 pm check-out, (based upon availability at only resort and conference center hotels), she seemed to enjoy telling me tough luck.at this point, my wife and i decided to cut our losses, check-out and go home early. one bad experience does not spoil my admiration for the w hotel chain, but when coming to atlanta, i would recommend the twelve hotel next door or the newly opened hotel palomar in midtown over the downtown w. the w is obviously still experiencing growing pains and desparate enough for revenue that they will accept whatever unsavory consequences might fall on their most loyal customers in their quest for it.\"when my husband and i arrived everything was fine until we got to the room. we had difficulty with the keys the entire time, spending at least 10min. each time trying to get the door to open. as we enter the room there fancy lamp wasn‚äôt working, there was clothes left in the draws, the chain to the blind broke, the room was noisy from the ac that was stuck on freezing, the second night there i wanted to purchase something to drink that was larger than the little can of soda that was in the room and was only given a choice of purchasing more little cans(6 @ 8.50 a piece, the price wasn‚äôt the problem it was quantity) and also there was something spilled on the chaise in the room. when i notified the front desk of this problem all i received was an empty apology and offer to be moved to a room that was a downgrade from what i had. i wasn‚äôt looking for anything free but it would have been ok if they gave me another room that was the same. after i saw that there was nothing that they were going to do to fix the situation i asked if they could send housekeeping up to the room to fix it. now i have stayed in many hotels all over the world (this being my second time staying at a sheraton property) and i even work for the sheraton, i have never experience such terrible service before. i figured since i work for the sheraton brand that i would at least try one of the hotels out but after what happened i am going back to the hilton properties. on a good note the concierge service was great the 2 ladies that were working were awesome they helped us with directions and ideas to keep us busy which meant less time in that room.do not stay here! staff is super nonchalant and unfriendly. they have power problems so you might get stuck in the elevator or dine on lukewarm food. just go further downtown and stay at a real hyatt that knows how to treat their hyatt members. i prefer midtown.party noise from downstairs penetrates guest rooms upstairs through ventilation system. 4th floor guest room and the party downstairs carried all the way up into room. also beware of surprise parking deck charges for adjoining self parking deck.i have never had such a negative experience during a hotel stay. the customer service was very poor. i have also been a fan of the hyatt regency for years and they are always my first choice, but i am afraid this stay will be my last one.this was the most terrible experience that i have ever had in a hyatt hotel! what a shame! this hotel does not respect the individual guest. i could not sleep since the hotel had a wedding event on a sunday evening/night and the event was booked until 11:00p.m. ( front desk confirmed that) the music played after 11:00 p.m. you could hear the bum music noise on all floors of the hotel very loud and clear all the evening and night. management of this hotel should realize that other guests are waking up at 4:00 or 5:00 a.m., and they came to the hotel to rest, this is not acceptable! either spend money and insulate the rooms better, or book events at sensible hours. the shower floor was disgustingly dirty. someone should clean the scum between the tiles. it is visibly black and dirty. i had to change the initial assigned room due to the unbearable smell of disinfectant/detergent/air freshner. they should not just spray a ton of air freshener and assign the room immediately to another guest. i am handicapped and i parked the car in front of the hotel to check in without having to carry my luggage from the parking lot. the valet literally snapped at me when i refused to give him the keys of my car. he stated that i cannot park in front of the hotel even if there were several other cars parked in the same place. i pleaded with him to allow me just to check in, he demanded my keys and i had to give him the keys. finally, one wonderful thing. the front desk young lady was exceptional. kind, patient, a good listener, great manners. she tried to assist the best she could.this was hands down the worst hyatt experience that i have ever had. we traveled to this property for a family wedding. the hotel is set in a business park, but had beautiful grounds in the back. the self-parking is connected to the hotel and is convenient for in and out travel. there is a starbucks (one of the best that i have been to) on the ground floor and a decent restaurant there as well.the check-in process was a nightmare, as they seemed unequipped to handle the number of people arriving. there was no call when the room was ready as promised and we had to move because the one thing that i had asked for (adjoining rooms) was not fulfilled.the rooms were standard and clean. nothing to view from the windows, and so floor will not matter. the walls were thin because i could hear a baby crying throughout the night. room service was so-so. first day breakfast was great, second day they left off the cream cheese for bagels and cream cheese and never brought it up.the pool was not cleaned and we waited until 11 to even try to use it. finally, my family member grabbed the sweeper and started dragging the leaves so that we could actually swim.the valet service was dismal and they left the hybrid car running and killed the battery. no apology, just blame being thrown around. so, yeah, skip this hyatt property. we paid a budget price and got budget service.overall it's a nice property but we were disappointed in the staff. greeted by four doormen who didn't offer to help with luggage, bartender was reading the newspaper during the happy hour. july 12 stay so check the cameras. totally inattentive staff but not to say they weren't nice, just not responsive. it took 3 calls to get bed sheets for the pull out. room service came missing silverware. it feels like a lack of training, perhaps poor management but it tarnished an otherwise nice property. for the price, there are better properties. i would have expected this at a roadside stop but this is marketed as a more premium property.william c., cassaundra and christina are true professionals, providing excellent customer service and they either meet or exceed expectations. many thanks to them for doing their part during our challenged filled stay:we ran into traffic friday night, which delayed our check-in. i called the hotel and spoke with sterling to advise that we were coming, but we‚äôre delayed and i didn‚äôt want our reservation to reflect a no-show. he indicated that he‚äôd speak with the night auditor to ensure that didn‚äôt occur. when we checked into the first room, an authorization for $551.40 was obtained, an additional authorization for $234.20 was also obtained for the second room (a one night stay). another authorization for $144.70 was processed the morning of checkout, which upon conversing with sterling was the no-show charge that he and the auditor were to speak about. he did advise that he‚äôd ensure that a refund is processed.the agent on duty during our check-in at 3am on saturday morning lacked friendliness and wasn‚äôt thorough during the check in process (explain how to use the garage entrance and exit, share the available amenities, to include onsite restaurants, etc.) sterling also lacked friendliness and though he was at the front desk when we were trying to check in the second reservation later on in the day, he opted to have a casual non-work related conversation with other hotel staff while we waited behind the guest that cassaundra was helping. when their conversation was finished, he still didn‚äôt help us...he started using the laptop, so we ended up having to wait for cassaundra. i don‚äôt mind waiting if it‚äôs in support of another guest, but that was not the case.there were 2 weddings at the hotel, so while i can appreciate that the hotel was at capacity (or so i was told), i had a second room due to check in on saturday and we didn‚äôt get access to that room until well after 6:30pm because the room hadn‚äôt been cleaned from the previous guest. check in was at 3, so we lost 3.5+ hours of use. the initial room that we checked into also hadn‚äôt been cleaned and we left at 10am, so it was available for hours. after several calls to the front desk, cassaundra was able to support us in getting both rooms cleaned, close to 7pm by the time we gained access.the hotel is beautiful and well kept, but the extremely late cleaning of the rooms was an inconvenience. housekeeping staff knocking to ask if we want the room cleaned well into the evening, while we‚äôre relaxing after being gone all day (room being available for hours) was very unfortunate.hyatt regency villa christina management has some work to do with hotel staff, to include housekeeping and front office staff.i booked the reservation based upon the excellent reviews. it could be that they were operationally at capacity, but it shouldn‚äôt impact anyone‚äôs stay.wouldn‚äôt necessarily recommend, why you say? well if you like mold in your shower and issues with your room that go unresolved this is the place! i stayed here twice in the past month due to work requirements; this time the shower had mold on the floor everywhere ~ i went to the front desk to ask for something to clean it with, they sent a lovely young lady up to do so. she worked on it for a bit then said she needed to get her supervisor. time went by and the supervisor never came so i headed back down to the front desk and on the way ran into the lady who told me her supervisor said it is the color of the tile. (seriously?) at the front desk i asked for the manager, explained the situation and asked to move rooms if the mold in the shower issue couldn‚äôt be resolved. surprisingly he sent the supervisor up. she took a look and wow it really must have been mold because a maintenance man came with a power scrubbing tool and was in the bathroom for half an hour with the door closed working ~ the outcome no mold where you stand the edges were another story. no follow up from management at all. my first visit the bathroom sink would not drain and items were missing in the room; pen and hand towels. i wrote a note for the desk staff with my room number and dropped it off. no results, the next day i rewrote the note and dropped it off again. overall the front desk staff and housekeepers were nice; however there is a huge disconnect with customer service. oh did i mention the battery on the tv remote and the room door went out too during my stay, at least they replaced the one on the door so i could get in. plus my peers has issues with their rooms ~ i‚äôll let them write their own review!the hotel‚äôs location is very nice, it‚äôs in a secluded part of the perimeter, great for a nice walk and away from all shopping. the room was also nice, however the service was a miserable failure.a ladybug and a cockroach in the bathroom, a few missing toiletries, breakfast that doesn‚äôt start till 7 am as well as atlanta‚äôs famous unfriendly service attitude are just a few things that made my rating a 2 star. no regency club, of course...parking is in a nice adjacent garage that overflows in the evening and then it becomes a nightmare as there is no street parking. valet also takes forever to get the car.the hotel has a fantastic potential; it is rather unfortunate that most people who work there dont hesitate to show how much they dislike their jobs and guests.this hotel was one of my favorites for the first couple of years it was open. it is still a great hotel, but if you are a business person and a globalist, take a warning about their breakfast service.they do not have a club room so you have to eat at the restaurant. they routinely forget to remove these meals from your bill so check your bill. the restaurant does not open till 7 am so if you are an early riser like me then it is useless. further, if you arrange for a meal via room service for breakfast, they failed to deliver break 3 times all together. the front desk even promised me they had made specific arrangements. they tried so hard to make it work.either they have a very poor room service manager or simply the hotel manager is not driving excellence end to end. not sure. the bars staff is awesome and i love jukka who manages the evening food. they are friends of mine at this point.bad experience the staff should‚äôve been way more concerned with my well being and making sure i was properly taken care of instead i felt rushed to get out and almost as if my money wasn‚äôt good enough cause my skin colorcheck-in with jones was great. it went downhill from there. my room was at 58 degrees when i checked in and outside temperature was in the 80's. it took 7 hours with the heat on to get the room back up to 70 degrees. the shower poured water on to the floor from under the shower doors. at least 1/2 gallon of water collected on the floor after each shower. the food in the restaurant was good but the portions too small. the chilean seabass was the size of a small appetizer. the portion was probably around 4 oz or less. the worst part is the shuttle. we initially relied on the shuttle to go back and forth to headquarters. most of the time we were mislead about the time it would leave or arrive. in more than 3 cases, it took over 90 minutes for the van to arrive. i understand there are times when it is busy but your staff should not tell someone the van is on its way when you know it is not. many times we were told it will be there in 10-15 mins\". there are 2 occasions in which it never arrived and we took uber back to the hotel after waiting 90 minutes. most of the drivers were totally disinterested in providing the hyatt experience we had expected. only one of them seemed to like their job. the others had no use for us and made it very clear we were bothering them. i cannot remember his name but he was pleasant and helpful with bags. the others just sat in the van, did not even help open doors or assist the women entering or leaving the van. the helpful man was the only one we tipped. one last point: i asked 3 days ago for an itemized bill of my stay since the amount charged to my credit card was greater than the bill i was given when i left. i wrote to the customer service address on the bill and no one has replied. i sent another message just a few moments ago. i am very disappointed with this hotel and definitely would not stay there again.\"let me preface this review by stating that i frequent marriott hotels, however i had a change of heart once i stayed at the grand hyatt dubai. this past weekend i chose to do a staycation at this property, and unfortunately it did not go as planned. the ongoing issue was lack of communication from employees to customers. when i checked in, the front desk manager honored the payment method (cash) that reservations told me i could do, although a card was on file. he was attentive, and made it a breeze to check in. later that friday night, into early saturday morning, i realized that i forgot my phone charger, and when i called down to ask for one, and the girl said she would send one up. thirty minutes later, i went downstairs to inquire about it, and i was told she couldn't find it, but the guy who could access them would be in by 7:30, and she would write a note to have one sent. needless to say, i ended up purchasing one from the store, and no one ever came. the parking should be explained that guests must use their hotel key to exit the parking garage. i observed people swiping credit cards or the line backing up and calling the hotel from cell phones. it would not take much effort to put a sign or sticker up to notify guests on this policy. then housekeeping was a joke. i specifically asked for a room with a tub, and my first night i took a bath, and the following morning i washed my hair. when i left out for the day and returned after 10 pm, the tub was still dirty with the ring around the tub, along with strands of my hair entangled in the bath mat ( which was obviously not taken up or cleaned). the toiletries were not replenished, nor was the bag to get ice replaced. i was too tired to go thru calling, so i cleaned my own, but did call for toothpaste and additional towels. finally, on the last day i went to the pool, but before i went, i called the front desk, and asked if towels were provided by the pool, and the girl said yes, but of course, after going down, that was not the case, and i had to go back up to my room to get towels. the recurring theme is the poor customer service and blatant disregard that people like to be informed. it is unfortunate, because the property is nice, but it doesn't really matter if all of your time is spent making sure that people do their job. i would stay here again on the condition that i do not stay away too long from my room so that i can check behind the housekeeping to make sure it is done correctly.this hotel was a dream that turned into a nightmare. my stay was wonderful a portion of the staff were great, the restaurants and bars were excellent, the room itself was extremely nice. my problem began at check out my credit card was double billed i was charged a no show fee and charged for a portion of the trip that was covered by expedia. i called and spoke to a manager who cleared most of the problem up and funds were deposited into my account, omg the very next morning my card was billed for an additional $501.00. i have called accounting who must be on an extended vacation the gm and hyatt corporate in chicago but to no avail. i am so disapponted because this property would have been my go to hotel for my bi-monthly trips to atlanta but no thanks i can't afford it. i guess i'll have to take the issue to small claims court if i don't get the issue rectified soon.we checked in at 1 am and were assigned a room that had not been cleaned. staff ended up putting us in a room that accommodated only two people but there were three of us. so, they ended up rolling in a cot, which was super uncomfortable. there were a number of other items that needed repair in the room and the construction of the hotel being very shoddy. would not stay in this property again.this was our first stay at the hyatt perimeter villa christina. the hotel was very clean. i am not sure how old the property is, but is looked fairly new. the location is also tranquil. all of the staff was extremely friendly. we would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.i stayed at hyatt regency for a business trip. i arrived after a bad day at work and was informed that they had upgraded my room. i entered my room to find an incredible, large suite. made a bad eeek much better! thank you hyatt!!the hyatt villa christina is a great stay. this was directly across the street from my customer. location couldn't be better. the dinning is delicious, there is an optional lunch buffet, along with a bar area if you need something quicker, along with a starbucks on premise.the workout facility was what i needed, newer well maintained equipment, with free weights up to 50lbs, and complimentary ear buds incase you forgot yours.there are also cupcakes, brownies, and cookies in the main lobby along with citrus infused water.rooms are spacious and comfortable.the 2 downsides are the building of a new multi-story office building (~20 stories). the other was a false fire alarm at 1 am. management did issue an apology letter enclosed with your bill, but not discount for the sleep interruption. that was disappointing. especially being i'm in customer relationship management.my room was filthy, smelled of marijuana and was overall the most disgusting room i've ever been in, especially at a hyatt. the front desk person was prompt in giving me another room, but the fear of someone being in my room when i returned from the event i attended downstairs made my evening very unpleasant. i had to have someone inspect my room every time i entered because of this fear.the place was a dump. dishes littered the halls all day for many days. need to improve the cleanliness to be acceptable. constantly having to avoid the land mines to get to our suite. stayed 3 days/2 nights so wasn't just a one off.so, i was staying in this hotel. something was stolen from my room. actually they went into my suitcase opened something up and took something valuable and of sentimental value. it takes 4 attempts and almost 24 hours to get the gm to speak with me. he pretty much called me a liar and a scammer. i will never recommend a hyatt hotel again.they are clueless. they gave away our room which we had reserved and even called many hours before to remind them we were on our way from across the country. need a strong gm and more highly trained and professional front desk staff.i selected this hotel because of the high reviews and was very excited to stay here but at the end of the stay i was highly dissatisfied! the hotel just never got it right and for what i paid for the two nights i just don‚äôt see it worth the high reviews. this was a special weekend for my girlfriend birthday so i was very excited to give her relaxing weekend. when we arrive to the hotel i parked the car out front and went inside to check in. once at the front desk i was greeted by a young lady that was very pleasant but this is where the whole weekend went downhill.she never displayed to me my room rate nor did she ask or tell me did i want to use a different card for room incidentals. all i got was a room keys and a finger point around the corner where the elevators were. let me say this i have 7 years in the hospitality industry and that a no, no! so i went to check the room and it was large and clean at least i thought. i went back down stairs to get my girlfriend and luggage. once i was almost done unpacking a gentleman with an african accent pops out of nowhere and was very abrasive about not parking where i was at.i told him that ‚äúi‚äôm done now and that i‚äôll just move the car.‚äù he just repeated what he said and i was like okay but he did take my cart. i believe he saw my annoyed facial expression and was trying to make up for it. any who we finally got to our room and my girlfriend was impressed at first until she saw that the shower was gross. dirt and soap scum was all in the grout like water was thrown on and never scrubbed. (picture below) lucky there was two showers in the room so that we could shower. as well as there was a lamp in the living area that wouldn‚äôt turn on but the blub was still hot. what is a hazard so i unplugged it and proceed to call down stairs and ask for the general manager.it was stated to me that the general manager wouldn‚äôt be in until the morning so i had to wait till then. we decided to leave the hotel and get something to eat but i was still bothered by the missed steps. so i decided to check my account and notice that it was charge $376.00 but my room rate with tax was $254.00 for the two nights. so i called the hotel while we were out to asked about my rate. a lady answered the phone and asked what i was being charged. she said $119.00 a night to which i said that‚äôs incorrect! it should $109.00 a night with a total of $254.00 for the two nights.i asked her what were the other charges in which she said incidentals. it was $50.00 a day for that plus the $20.00 that was over charge to me. what made me even more upset was i don‚äôt understand why the front desk agent never stated this too me so that i could have corrected then as well as put down another card for incidentals. very frustrating to me because it could have been avoided when i checked in. so when morning arrived i called to the front desk and asked when will the general manager be in and the guy stated at 11:00am. i said okay and stated that i would call back then.the night before we preordered room service for breakfast the following morning before we went to sleep. the room service came on time and it seem like it was going to great day at the hotel. then we notice that not all our items we ordered actually came. so once again i had to call down and get someone to bring us the rest of our items.i decided to come down and talk to the general around 11:00am which they told me that he already left for the day. he was there at 6am and left around 10am, which mean that a staff member lied to me. i stated that i needed to get the room rate change because it was incorrect. so they got me the assistant manager michael.once again i stated to him that my rate was wrong in which he stated that because i ‚äúextended my rate that it was the reason the rate went up.‚äù which pissed me off even more because that was not the case because i booked the room 3 weeks in advance for 2 nights through trip advisor, second you can see it on my hyatt rewards and third i had the confirmation number of it. i really felt like my intelligence was being tested on something so simple as a rate change.eventually after the back and forth michael finally corrected the mistake and we tried to continue on with the day celebrating my girlfriend birthday. i did make a reservation for a massage from buckhead massage which my girlfriend stated was very good so that was one positive so far even though it not part of the hyatt brand.through our time here it seems that we receive so, so, so treatment than other customers and i just didn‚äôt get it. was it because we weren‚äôt having a wedding at the place or a baby shower? did i have to throw money in the air to get the same service as others? i mean even the staff was rude at times, i just don‚äôt get it. so when i checked out i asked to speak with the general manager again and once again he was not in. so i had to speak with michael again (oh great) and explain to him my disappointment with the stay.he listens to my concerns like he was supposed to do and offered us bunch on the house. i accepted and thought maybe this could be a good note to the visited. its wasn‚äôt, now the bunch at the restaurant was very impressive and the food was good. sigh, but the rudeness and uncleanness continued!! we sat down and once the server greeted us she asked what did we want to drink. we ordered water and mimosas in which she brought two glasses and one of them had a lipstick all over it. i told her no on that glass and did you see that? she said she was sorry, which seems like everyone was doing at the hotel the whole weekend. after that we asked for straws and never received them. my girlfriend had to search around and found some stirrers to make due.when it comes down to it i paid $304.84 for a horrible weekend‚ä¶.what a lovely hotel! has beautiful surroundings & very quiet. the staff are so friendly, welcoming, helpful & wonderful service from them. nothing is a problem for them. the room was lovely. so clean & modern! we stayed for 6 nights & the staff were so good in that we asked for ceramic coffee mugs & glasses rather than the disposable cups they provided & were so accommodating. we highly recommend this lovely hotel! thank you so much for making our stay so memorable! first trip to the usa, atlanta for business & hopefully we will return again to this hotel.waited all day (arrived @ 9:30) having pre-requested early check-in when available. all of my colleagues got their rooms (even those who had not pre-requested) & i was not updated as promised about it and in the end, did not get a room until 3pm. the staff did not seem to care very much!!!the hotel is a boutique hotel with ample meeting space, exercise facilities and dining options. the only problem is the $50.00 daily incidentals fee that you only find out about when you check in, so be prepared to pay for that up front, although you eventually get it back. be more transparent!!very little greetings and poor service from the receptionists (not just one day, over few days period) - no good morning, good evening, was not asked for any newspapers when checked in and during check out, the receptionist didn‚äôt even ask how was our stay, one of the poorest hyatt hotels we have ever stayed and definitely will not rebook this hyatt again, and will rethink book any hyatt in the future.we didn‚äôt choose a 4*/5* hotel to be totally ignored by the hotel staff, very cold service, you have to ask right questions to have correct answers from the staff, they certainly didn‚äôt do more than they should‚ä¶we have stayed many hotels all over the world, and was really amazed by this hotel‚äôs poor quality service.i would love to give this hotel 4 stars because it has the potential to be 4 stars.the grounds are gorgeous. the staff front desk staff were amazing.the hotel bar is ok. service was great, i will get more into that later.i always take clorox bleach wipes and lysol spray with me when i travel. thank goodness because it came in handy this time. my room was not clean. the bathroom sink, tub, mirror were dirty. the dressers had sticky residue on all of them. i found unused cigarettes in my room, if housekeeping had cleaned the room it would if obviously been found.i inspected the sheets they seemed to be okay but i was to tired to care at this point.the hotel bar has a sunday brunch for $35 per person. the brunch is mediocre at best. i would highly suggest going to a much better local restaurant. honestly, i would rather have waffle house (depending on the location,than the brunch here)so the sad thing was i found a fly in my bacon the staff was very apologetic and accommodating and they comped my meal for me and gave me a free drinkthe hotel is beautiful and the location is very safe.we lived in atlanta for almost 20 years, came back for a weekend getaway and to go to a concert. while the property is nice, the service was spotty. they cater to large groups, weddings/meetings. the food was nothing special. i ordered soup and it was not hot, the pasta was just ok. the bar service was incredibly slow. it looked like they had at least two weddings over the weekend and another meeting. their staff was probably overwhelmed with that.i so wanted to give this property 4-5 stars. this was my first visit for business and this hotel is beautiful - ~ 1 yr old and staff at greeting, bar and check-in are great - friendly and genuine. problem was fire alarm at 1 am (it happens and not the hotel's fault). alarms and fire doors all worked but i and other guests did not see 1, i mean 1, staff member as we shuffled outside. people milling in the middle of the road as the fire truck pulled up. no one ever came out to explain situation or tell us where to congregate. and firefighters (it was clearly a fire panel false alarm, again it happens and better safe than sorry) told us to come back in - no staff anywhere!raised the issue next morning at check out and did not accept being comp'd in some way, rather wanted them to address - they seemed surprised that no staff was present 6 hours earlier. i was promised the ops manager would call me - s/he never did and its been almost a week.blown away how clueless this facility was and how poorly staffed in the middle of the night. its beautiful but hyatt corp needs to address.before we moved near here i stayed at a hotel in atlanta every other week for almost a year. i stayed all over the city but primarily with hilton earning diamond status. whenever i travel now, i stay at a hilton hotel. we live about an hour away, my wife had to be at a customer site nearby at 6am, so i tagged along as we made a 3 night getaway out of it. we chose this hotel for one reason and one reason only - the tripadvisor rating - # 2 out of 191 hotels. based on my experience, i have no idea how they achieved such a rating. we stayed for 3 nights. here is a summary of our stay. check in was quick and easy, the staff were all quite friendly. when we got to our room we unpacked and i went to plug in my cpap machine and phone charger on the nightstand but didn't see any outlets so i pulled the nightstand out to reveal a very dusty area behind the nightstand. i unplugged the wireless phone and alarm clock and moved them to the tv stand. i plugged in my phone and cpap. the next morning i asked them to vaccuum behind the nighstand, but more on the 1st night: we went to bed at 10pm as we were supposed to get up around 4:30 or 5:00. first around 11pm the alarm clock went off, i should have checked it before i went to bed, my mistake? then the fire alarm for the building went off at 1:00am. after the alarm sounded i called the front desk and i was told we had to evacuate the building. i have muscle and nerve damage in my feet and legs so sometimes walking is quite painful, especially when going down stairs. nevertheless i made my trek down i think 5 or 6 flights which exited out behind the garage. we joined many other guests and waited about 20-30 minutes until the fire department cleared us to go back in. while waiting for the elevator to clear up i overheard an employee stating to another guest something about the kitchen, an employee and the fire alarm. the next day when we asked them to vacuum the dusty area we found, we also complained about the employee and the fire alarm to which their response was well we can't control our employees\" which was an odd thing to say.. when we returned later that evening we found our room was cleaned and the area behind the nightstand was cleared of the dust... but the person that cleaned also plugged back in the alarm clock and cordless phone and now my phone charger cord was nowhere to be found. i looked around and couldn't find it. i picked up the cordless phone to call the front desk but it had no dialtone, i picked up the main phone and it also had no dialtone - i just used it the night before. after some checking around i found that the rj11 connector, connector on the end of the phone cable, was unplugged from the phone - the clip on it was not broken so it should not have fallen out by itself. it was positioned in way that i believe was to make it look like it was plugged in to the phone. in my honest opinion someone was mad and sabotaged our phone, why do i say this? because i also found my found cord - under the bed. so we called the manager and he came up to our room. we showed him what we found and how we believed these items were done on purpose. he was very apologetic and agreed that the phone cord my phone charger location didn't make sense. he promised to do 2 things in particular for us and promised us that our 3rd night would be \"a day to remember\" or something like that. what we found is that everyone at the hotel is extremely friendly to you face to face... i believe they are taught lines like a script and do a great job at repeating them. the 2 things that the manager promised to us only 1 of them happened, they cleaned our room, wow, what a promise to deliver on. the other promise never happened. when we checked out we noticed that promise wasn't followed through on and our bill was incorrect to which the person checking us out said she didn't know and kind of just giggled nervously. she didn't know how to respond. at that point we were just glad to leave. i shall not be returning to this hyatt hotel next time my wife and i want to get away, if we come back to this area we'll stay at the hilton garden inn around the corner. i will continue to stay at hilton hotels and earn my free night stays and be treated like a valued guest. other notes, the wifi in this hotel is terribly slow - there isn't an option to purchase premium internet like most other hotels offer. we ordered room service a couple times, the food from the restaurant is incredible! 5 stars all the way for the restaurant. the price we paid for the hotel was a bit higher than what we're used to paying but we expected this to be a hotel that rated in the top 1% of hotels.... we were very displeased with our stay.\"we stayed at this hotel for 3 days. super clean, nice location, awesome neighborhood, great parking!!! everything was brand new, they were hosting a wedding and other events and yet it was very calm and organized!!! great helpful staff! we got the king room and asked for an extra bed for my little boy, free of charge. this is the best place to stay in altanta!!!!!!! breakfast is not included but totally worthy!!! we really enjoyed our stay!!!new, beautiful, serene environment, wonderful location, staff was very friendly & helpful. the gardens were tranquil and the food at villa christina was very good. will definitely stay here again on my next visit to atlanta perimeter area!if you don't want to read my long review, here is the summary:book this hotel now!!!at the last minute my sister and i decided we didn't want to be on the road for our 29th birthday and decided to book this hotel!! we are true hotel snobs and this hotel did not disappoint!!! the valet staff was very nice and helped us with our bags even though it was freezing outside!!! (the hotel has free parking or valet parking for $16/day (i think))we walked inside and we were amazed by this updated, modern, sleek, clean, hotel!!! everything about the hotel is grand! when we got to the front desk we had a speedy check-in process and we were even offered a late checkout since we arrived at 1am! they even acknowledged it was our birthday!!!the room was beyond immaculate!! this is one of those instances where i can say the pictures on the hotel website truly represent the room! no photoshop needed because the rooms are great!!i loved the keyless entry system! just wave your card and it unlocks the room. the only complaint i had was about the pillows. and the hotel has already contacted me to say they'll look into purchasing additional pillows.now....this bed!!!omg!! the most comfortable bed i've ever slept in!! it screams, come sleep in me and you'll never want to move!!overall great hotel!!! i've already booked my second stay for a cousin's birthday celebration weekend in february!!this hotel set the standards high!! i was so disappointed when i checked out and arrived at my other hotel\" (insert sad face)! i compared everything to this hotel and nothing could match it!!\"over the past 15 years, georgia cancer specialists has held their physicians/shareholders monthly meeting at villa christina. this is a large (50 or more) event and with many strong personalities. gary burgess, your employees is at the top of his game, each and every time he is our host/lead person. he answers each question, addresses and fixes any problems that arise, ie. a computer issue, room too hot or too cold, is this entree gluten free?. we know if he is our host for the evening, we will have no problems.upgraded upon check in to a suite and loved it. so very nice and indulgent. hard to find anything wrong until my trembling hand accepted the bill for the room. there was $100 in taxes alone for the room. it's a tough bill to pay. i'm not of the ilk where this hotel is normal. i'll retreat into my hole for a while and suffer the whallop of such a big bill.if you can afford it, go! no flaws.very nice hotel. i like cleanliness and this hotel definitely offers that. the parking is valet only and expensive to me ($42). the one issue i had was being charged for the honor bar that i didn‚äôt use. i have called multiple times trying to resolve this. i was told it would come off my card but after almost a month, still no resolution. this is not cool at all. once again very nice hotel but don‚äôt try to get over on me! if not for this ongoing issue, i would have rated it better.the hotel lived up to our high expectations except for one glaring problem. we had a suite - extremely roomy - virtually an apartment. however, one day they never cleaned the room even though the electronic button to make up room\" was lighted. assured it was an oversight and would never happen again, it did. for a second day, they failed to clean our room despite a lighted request button. how does this happen for platinum starwood members?\"booked two nights (10th / 11th dec 2017) via reservation counter (not directly with the hotel). the rc cancellation policy was the 6th dec, due to the severe weather in atlanta i attempted to cancel (or move my dates) on the 7th when delta airlines sent a notification regarding possible extended delays into and out of atlanta, ga. the hotel indicated that they would work with me but that i needed to have reservation counter call the hotel. rc (reservation counter) stated that the hotel would not work with me. the rc are within their rights to stick-it-to me as i agreed to the reservation policy (one night penalty $800) i was extreemly disappointed by my mistake in not booking with the st regis directly. i am rest assured that in sickness or in health rc will stick to their policy devoid of empathy or flexibility. this has been a very expensive mistake on my part and i shall not put myself in this position again by booking anything via rc moving forward. respectfully, don o'reillyduring my stay i was treated with the greatest service and beyond . the staff was spot on with excellent service and professionalism. room service was outstanding and the food and beverage at the hotel was incredible. i will be returning again often for business and look forward to my next stay. the bar is by far the greatest place in buckhead. this hotel is the greatest place by far in atlanta. it's a must stay.sincerelythomas cookhotel is nice enough - some doors don't close all the way and lighting is pretty poor, especially in the bathroom.that said i found a bogus $270 honor bar charge on my account. they reversed it upon a call, but wonder how often do they try to sneak in these type of extra charges.i made a reservation 2 months ahead of our trip and requested specific things, balcony, location of the room, birthday ammenities, etc. as i am a repeat guest of several times a year for many years. i can not say how appalled and disappointed i was with our check in and room condition and lack of concern and professionalism by the staff and mgt staff. the hotel review responder, mr. merl states that we guarantee our rooms to be ready for arriving guests at 3pm. this ensures that the rooms vacated by our departing guests can be serviced. of course, we always do our best to accommodate the guests arriving before this time, however this is not always possible and solely depends on what time the previous guest departed. if you would like to arrange on future visits to pre-book your room from the evening before you arrive, we can assure early access.\" this is bs as we pre-booked 2 mos in advance and arrived at 3:05 pm and were told that our room was not ready and and told we could wait in the bar with complimentary drinks while we waited. they also said they were trying to get us upgraded accommodations and they would call us when that room was ready. i had already reserved \"upgraded accommodations when i made the reservation 2 months earlier and said we really would just like to have the room i had already reserved. they then said that they had a big party the night before and were behind getting the rooms cleaned but would have ours ready in a few minutes if we like to wait in the bar. so we went to bar. 45 minutes later we checked with the front desk and they had a shift change and didn't know we were waiting in the bar!! we asked for the mgr and he said he was sorry but our room still was not ready but he would upgrade a room promptly for us and suggested we wait back in the bar and have more complimentary drinksi! we said we would wait in the lobby for him to expedite our upgraded room. at 5:15 pm we were finally called for our room and it was not upgraded and in fact it wasn't what i had reserved in the first place-a room with a view other than the parking garage-but that is exactly where they put us. the champagne i had ordered for my birthday (2 months earlier at reservation) did not arrive and i had to call for it. we had reservations at atlas and had to get ready so we didn't readily notice the condition of the room until very late that night. grout in the shower was loose, coffee expresso cup was dirty, sprayer in the bathroom didn't work, the mirrors between the bath and bedroom were not clean, stains on the floor-looked like coffee stains, a hole in the seat of the canvas chair, apparent wine stain on the bottom of the comforter, no shampoo, etc in the soaking tub and no extra toilet tissue. we had to call about all the things -multiple times as we didn't notice them all at once. we finally asked to move rooms for our 2nd and 3rd nights but \"they didn't have any rooms that would be available for both nights. they said they would re-clean the room\" - really?? a 4 star hotel and this is what your remedy is after all this? mr merl stated in previous reviews that \" he would like to offer my sincerest apologies that your accommodations were not up to our usual high standard. overall, i am very disappointed that on this occasion your visit did not live up to your expectations.\" well--it happened again. we won't be staying here for awhile in hope they can fix their problems. our next stay will be at the mandarin which has yet to disappoint!\"during my stay i was treated with the greatest service and beyond . the staff was spot on with excellent service and professionalism. room service was outstanding and the food and beverage at the hotel was incredible. i will be returning again often for business and look forward to my next staysincerelythomas cookwe love st. regis atlanta. my husband and i make a reservation every year for our anniversary. we are locals, but it feels like we are away on vacation every time we stay at st. regis. the staff strives for excellence, the pool is amazing, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere lives up to the st. regis name. we talked going away for an anniversary one year, but why would we? st. regis is our true happy place. we love everything about it.i recently had a 2 night business stay at the st regis. really a beautful hotel, luxurious finishes, spacious and tastefully appointed rooms. also a great location in buckhead. my lovely room was marred by the smell and presence of mold in the shower. at check in, i inquired about the rate and was assured the conference rate was good for both nights of my stay. my bill at checkout reflected something different and the night clerk (early flight) told be me he would check and have someone call me. our corporate travel agent got a statement later with the higher rate via email without explanation . due to the limited cable coverage of the playoffs, i spent part of two evenings on the pub watching the closed captioned version of the limited cable coverage of the playoffs. christopher was an attentive and professional bartender. one of the servers, kendall, approached me and asked if i had any hand lotion. i was really taken aback and had honestly wondered if it was code for something as i had observed what look like call girl activity in the bar the prior evening. in the world of instant feedback, i was surprised i did not get a  how was your stay\" email after checkout. kind of telling....\"thanks be to god..... we had a lovely experience .... we had an emergency hotel switch and knew that we would be in great hands...they were more than accommodating ... the food and wine was delicious ... great location in buckhead...catered to our every whim..they were there to please and literally were catered to 100 percent ... private car (black mercedes) whisked me where i needed to go while my husband was in his meeting...delicious lattes etc... rooms were beautiful and spacious ... couldn't have had a better time .... thank u to all of the staff!!!!i was here for a wedding , the service was great!! this hotel made my friend special day amazing!!!! everything was first class!!!!! her wedding suite was everything someone could ask for!! the butler was super helpful and the staff remained very professional!!showed up at 3:15 pm for a 3pm check in and had to wait over an hour for my room. inattentive bar staff and lackluster service all around. this is a textbook example of a hotel that presents an elegant and classy facade and then does not back it up.for the money, you are much better off elsewhere.i stayed here with my family for a few days while visiting extended family in atlanta. this is the second time at this hotel - first time for me, second time for my husband, who was here on a business trip. i was really looking forward to staying here, and i had already been reading ta reviews about atlanta hotels, as i haven't been back home since 2008.we drove down in a rental car, and arrived bang on the dot at the check-in time of 3pm. the outside of the hotel looks really lovely, and we were all a little tired after driving all day, so everyone brightened up at the sight.we went inside and were checked in by a nice young lady, who informed us that our rooms were almost ready\", and that we could have a drink or go to the pool if we wanted to. i don't want to go to a pool after i have been driving all day - i want to go to my room. the upstairs mezzanine area was busy, so i assumed the hotel was at full capacity. i agreed to sit down for a complimentary drink in the bar. we went to the bar, and walked in. empty except for two bartenders watching tv, and a few couples with drinks. no one even bothered to look at us or turn their heads. we sat outside, where there was one woman with a wine glass and another lady just leaving. we waited about 3 or 4 minutes, until another bartender came outside - a very nice young man from romainia, who ended up being fantastic. he served us drinks and gave us complimentary macaroons, which no one ate because it was by then after 4 in the afternoon and we still didn't have our room. can you believe that?? i asked about it, and learned that apparently starwood members can leave their rooms whenever they want. the previous guests had apparently just checked out.... what i don't understand is why, at a fairly largish hotel, no effort is made to stop this kind of thing from happening. we ended up staying in a double room until 5pm.. that's right - 5pm, and finally got into our rooms. the kids ordered room service because they were too whacked out to go anywhere, and my husband and i just went back to the bar and got some flatbread... we came back to the room, saw the dirty dishes and called room service to pick the dishes up. no one ever came. nope, they never showed up. i wanted to toss the dishes out in the hall! we didn't even have a rolling tray to put them on and set them in the hall! so i got to sleep with food smells all night, like i was in the barrio. thank you.next morning, my husband had a breakfast meeting which , thank goodness, went ok, then brought two colleagues back to our room to work in the dining area. guess what? dishes still there at 11 am. and no housekeeping either...really? the st. regis is a 5 star hotel?my husband had to call someone to come - and then this fool had the nerve to start banging plates around during a conference call.... until all the men stared at him and he finally got the message and got the stuff quietly out of the room.the rest of our stay was the same. the bathroom was never fully cleaned - the tub always had grime on it, every night we were there. the prices for everything are outrageous for what you get - which is basically nothing. we had a \"butler\" which really means another obstacle who doesn't help at all. i would try to call the concierge for stuff- but get the butler. i would ask her or him my question, and she would say, oh, let me call the concierge for you. witw! i felt like i was living in crazy town! tried to get a hair appointment, no dice. only at 4pm the start of my event. and had to go through 10 people to get to her!and- i am saving this for the last - we also got conned by a random con man on the first day we were there, on the terrace of the bar. i have to say, this was partially our fault because we were rubes, but at the same time, be aware that there is no security at this hotel at all. nothing. this dude just walked up from somewhere, presented himself to the most likely looking victims, - us - and asked us for $40 to get his \"flat tire fixed\". we were whacked out from driving, and sitting in the sun, and didn't think that anyone would have the nuts to come up into a luxury hotel and do something like this... so we gave it to him. my advice to you- don't stay here. it isn't worth it. all these mistakes, and only two employees that i came across were worth a second look, we paid over a thousand dollars a night to stay in interconnecting rooms that were large, but dirty, i hardly saw housekeeping, and the only positive thing i can say is that the beds were comfortable and we did not have a shower curtain this time. luckily.no effort was made to make us comfortable beyond, i am sorry, four free drinks, and a movie pass for a \"free movie\" which wasn't even taken off our bill! that is the standard of st. regis atlanta.not only am i never coming here again, i am never going to try any st. regis hotel - anywhere!\"the hotel and staff are extraordinary. some room hipcups but very nice overall.however the bar on weekend is more like a roadhouse bar than st regis with many rude and drunk people, not guests of property . a full on bloody fight last time. this bar is dragging down the hotel experience but making money so no control ? no place for a quiet drink at all.atlas is wonderful place to eat, 5 star experience .stayed only one night. was told its a new hotel and ill love it. i did love the lobby and the bar even though the staff was very slow. i got into my suite and it smelled so much like chlorine i had to move. new room was so dirty feeling. burns in carpet, hair in bathroom, closet floor not vacuumed just bad. to many better options in atlanta to stay somewhere that is not clean.we planned to stay for a 24-hour staycation at this hotel in hopes of having a relaxing getaway. i'm a platinum starwood prefered guest, having traveled the world and stayed at many luxury hotels, including several other st. regis properties. unfortunately, at this particular property in atlanta, our experience was horrific from the start. we reserved a suite, and arrived at 2:30 p.m., hoping to check in a few minutes early to enjoy the afternoon by the pool. understandably, it wasnt quite ready and we were told it would be ready by 3:00. we went to the bar, had a few drinks, but at 430 we still have not received an update and the suite was still not ready. when i checked in with the front desk, they indicated it was finally ready, gave us the keys and we went upstairs only to find out that there was still chocolate cake on the floor and empty cups of ice and a cleaning crew still actively working to clean up what was likely a big party from the night before. upon returning to the front desk, they were a bit surprised, but didn't really offer us any options. in hopes of just getting a room so we can relax in advance of our dinner reservation, i indicated i would even be open to takinga regular room. at 5:00 it was finally ready. walked in the room and the first thing i noticed was multiple stains all over the carpet. not five minutes later, after putting our bags down in the suite, the doorbell rang and it was security indicating he needed to work on the safe. i let him know there did not appear to be anything wrong with the safe, and just asked him to come back later if it was absolutely necessary. only five minutes later the doorbell rang again and it was hotel maintenance, indicating he needed to work on the shower head. to no surprise, there was nothing wrong with the shower head and he, too,embarrassingly left. at this point it was about dinner time, & i called downstairs to the bell desk to request that their car take us to dinner. i was told it was a first come first serve basis and we would just have to come downstairs and see if it was available, not exactly what i would expect from a 5-star hotel. once we got downstairs, it took several minutes to get one of the valet or bellhop's attention and they indicated they would have to call the driver to see where he was. after we waited anothe 5 minutes, they indicated he would not be back for 10 or 15 minutes. i called and got my own car, again, not something i would expect having to do at a five star hotel. this morning, yes, i'm writing this from the hotel, my wife had an appointment at the spa at 10 a.m.. like most spas, they encouraged her arrive early to enjoy the overall experience. she went down there at about 9:30 only to find out the spa didn't open until 10, and stood with nothing to do in a hallway with about 5 other people waiting for their services to begin as well. she called the front desk where there appeared to be extreme confusion as to when the spa even opened, as they led her to believe someone should be there already. she texted me at 5 minutes past 10 indicating her appointment had still not begun. needless to say, she is not ecstatic about paying for this 60 minute massage. i just went downstairs to try and communicate some of my concerns to the general manager, but he or she is not on property today, and for that matter, there is no manager apparently on property in till 230. as you can imagine, i'm hoping i will be checked out well before 2:30 this afternoon and have no real intention of ever returning to this property and certainly not recommending it anyone that may visit us in atlanta. the concierge assured me that someone will be calling me, & i will update this review if i hear back from anyone. if you are looking for a nice property in atlanta, i recommend the four seasons or mandarin oriental. i have stayed at both and the service out paces the st. regis significantly.i have stayed here well over 20 times. my wife and i checked in around 5:30, and the room was pitch black, and they had done some attempt of turn down service( no chocolates). tried to turn on a light and the bulb was out. went to use the bathroom and the paint is bubbling from moisture in the room. we get ready to go out, and press the make up the room botton, upon our return nothing was touched. we will be searching other options next month.we were visiting friends in buckhead so thought the st regis would be a good choice. i should have paid more attention to the other reviewers who said the mandarin is better which i'm sure it is.it's the typical st regis, so furnishings are nice, so is the pool, staff are accommodating, but imho things just aren't particularly well thought out. for example, they have a tv in the mirror in the bathroom supposedly so you can watch from the tub - but the way it's positioned you would have to have your back in the faucet to see it. lots of silly things like that.the bellman didn't set up the bags in the room so my husband was not pleased about that and dinner at the astor court was bland and boring and ridiculously overpriced for what it is. we won't return.party in the room next door woke us up at 1:15 am with loud music, pounding base and loud voices. after numerous complaints it was suggested that we change our room. i have never been treated so rudely in any hotel i have ever stayed in.while seeking a scenic venue for a celebration, i ran across the st. regis atlanta facility on the internet. i was mesmerized by the pictures so i decided that this was the perfect spot for my celebration. my original contact with several employees via telephone was good.. after reviewing the menu options, i had one or two questions about menu items before proceeding to make my final confirmation. after making numerous calls & leaving messages to confirm with the astor court supervisor, i still don't have a confirmation when my prospective celebration date is in january. i know that we all have busy schedules but following up is essential to good customer service.i have written many reviews on tripadvisor although i have not done one in a while but felt compelled to write one today. i stayed at the st. regis atlanta this past weekend for a staycation for my 40th bday. for a point of reference i travel quite a bit for work and personal trips.approx. 120 nights a year. most frequented chains in order are ritz, jw, mandarin, starwood lux collection, and st. regis.here is what i can share with the tripadvisor community about the st. regis. this is my first time doing a staycation at the atlanta st. regis. i frequently do staycations at other atlanta hotels.pros: the hotel is what you would expect. fantastic property! rooms are great as is the entire property. there is nothing negative to say about the property itself.cons: i have stayed at many st. regis properties. i personally believe that the st. regis brand in general is a superior brand and the main reason is service! i was increadibly disapointed in the service at the st. regis atlanta. it simply was not on par with the brand as a whole. not from all departments. in fact certain aspects of the hotel are st. regis\" quality no question. others are shockingly no where remotely close to the stratosphere of what i am use to from a st regis property. this is the first time i have stayed at a st. regis where everything wasn't \"st. regis\" quality. very disapointing! certain aspects were holiday inn. pains me to say it as i am a huge fan of the brand and generally feel like they do it better than the rest. hope others have a better experience.\"i recently stayed at the st. regis in buckhead. from the front desk, to room service, to their car service, i have had a fantastic experience. there is no lack of great hotels in buckhead...namely the ritz carlton, but the st. regis puts them all to shame. with one stay, the st. regis has become my hotel\" of choice in atlanta. next time, i want to be able to try out their spa!\"after my stay at st. regis in december, 2012, an extra charge appeared on my account for the honor bar.\" i never used the \"honor bar.\" i contacted the hotel (it took 3 days with multiple calls to speak to a real person) and was told my account would be credited for the erroneous charge, but it would take a \"few days\" to appear on my account. 5 weeks later, no credit. hotel amenities are very nice, business office is suspect.\"great hotel, very nice room but none of that mattered when i got my bill and found i was charged $122.95 for items from the honor bar (mini bar). i took two, 1.7oz bottles of jim beam from the mini bar. took three phone calls over three days (left two messaged that were never returned, finally insisted on speaking with the manager before i got someone who could help) to get a resolution. turns out that there was in fact a problem with my charge. i should have only been charted $41.08 each for the bottles. so $82.16 was the correct amount for 3.4oz of jim beam. what a joke. totally ruined my opinion of the place. clearly i'll never touch the mini bar again, but i won't stay at this hotel again either out of principal.i love the st. regis in atlanta. this hotel lives up to the st. regis name. i have stayed in the st. regis suite and in the grand luxe rooms on the 3rd floor which have huge patios. those rooms on the 3rd floor in my opinion are a better value than the st. regis suites. the st. regis bar offers one of a kind drinks. the st. regis is my favorite hotel in atlanta.i recently stay at the hotel in atlanta for business for over two weeks. i experienced very poor room service, i ordered the same breakfast everyday and it was different everyday. often, taking over an hour for delivery. on two occasions the staff forgot to deliver the food. the valet service takes about 30 minutes to get your car, so make sure you call ahead if you are in a hurry. the bathroom shower was had mold on the walls. over all my i thought the hotel was nice but the service is 2 star at best. this is extremely over priced for this level of service. i would not stay here again.i stayed at the st. regis the weekend of may 13, 2012. i have stayed many times. while i consider this to be a hotel on par with any i have st ayed at in the world, the service is beginning to slip. it took the bellman over 30 minutes to get me ice. when i asked for an aspirin the answer was flatly, we do not have any. no there is a drug store close by\" just too bad. i am in atlanta often for business and i am re-considering making ritz carlton bulkhead my hotel of choice.\"the service and rooms are impeccable. room service breakfast, as well as the breakfast on the mezzanine were great. the bar is deluxe, but gets crowded.a few glitches, though. the denon radio had no reception, so no music unless you bring your own cds or ipod. the valet parking at $34/day is steep, and no self-parking was offered. we had 6 minis from the honor bar. guess i should've looked harder for a price list: the damage was $165, including a gratuity\" for serving myself!\"the st. regis - atlanta was at best mediocre. the suite\" was unacceptable. most people want a door between the bedroom and living room. we get a suite so that if one can't sleep, the partner can go in the other room and read or watch tv. very poor design.the sliding glass door was filthy.we ordered coffee on sat. morning, which never came;i had a special event on sat. night and ordered a special \"angel\" cake. it was an ordinarybirthday cake. although pleasant tasting- not what i ordered.if you look at what i paid for a couple of days, it was outrageous for the service and food.i would never stay there again, and will make sure any of my friends who go to atlanta do not waste their money.\"second visit at this hotel. still a wonderful and luxurious hotel. great food in the restaurant! (very surprised to see that there the restaurant was almost empty.) and i like to location too.however, there are still room for improvements.i was surprised to see that there were no welcome back\" at check in. and in the welcome letter that was waiting in my room, i was - as last time - titled as \"mrs\". i laughed of it last year, but was more annoyed this year. how manly must i be before i become a \"mr\" at this hotel?service at the pool was not good. had to wait forever before we were asked if we wanted anything, and the ice water we ordered never came. had to walk up to the bar area and ask if they had forgotten us. they seemed very occupied with some glamourous vips in the pool, who were buying a lot of drinks.traffic noise from paces road was quite noticable. ask for a room not facing the road.it was very difficult to block the light out of the room at night. drapes were short, and there were all sorts of devices that lit up the room.doors slamming loudly when open/shut a problem. as usually - hard to understand why hotels of this class do not install door mechanism to prevent this.\"as usual st. regis puts all other hotels to shame. facility, staff, food, and beverage was five stars.i checked into the beautiful st. regis after an exhausting day of travel and consulting. i had a great meal and then just wanted to go to sleep. the nightmare began. as i tried to go to sleep, i kept hearing indian flute music. i called the front desk four times asking for help and for ear plugs - no one seemed to be able to help. on another note, the phone rang over 25 times before anyone answered my call - maybe then just didn't want to hear from me again. finally, at 10pm, i requested to be moved - not a smooth transition, but moved to a new room. the room was quiet and i went to sleep. i woke up at 3:30 to hear new music - this time piano music. after trying to muffle the sound, i then called down to the front desk. i let the young man in my room and he too heard the music, now at 4am, i am waiting for the engineer to try to silence the sound. the least they should be able to provide is ear plugs. the st. regis is not so saintly after all!i'm in my room, 914, a suite, with some thoughts.let's see what $790 / night gets you.- we left our room for the day at 10:30 returned at 2:00 and it was still not made up. called my butler\" and asked them to have it made up. they said \"right away\". it's 3:30 and....nothing. finally i asked and just said come after we leave for dinner at 5. i hope we have enough towels.- more service - calling the front desk and nobody answers the phone. i let it ring for 5 straight minutes and....nothing. called the butler again and she said someone would call back. nobody did.- want ice? waited 50 minutes, asked twice? come on.- how about turndown? didn't happen either. no water? i have to get the $20 smart water in the fridge?this is the first time i have ever complained or written a review.i'm sorry, these people just dont care. if i'm in one of the most expensive rooms in the hotel, i can't imagine what happens with other guests.try the ritz, go anywhere. you are wasting your time here.\"i ordered 2 eggs with bacon and sausage with no potatoes. the gave me the potatoes and the bacon was awful. one piece wasn't cook and the other was so cooked it wasn't able to chew it. i waited a long time for the check and needed to leave. when i told the server she offer new food although it was too late and didn't take it off the check. the food is very expensive and the quality is not good. i don't think it was worth the money paid.first time here and left very relaxed and happy...the empire suite was perfect and the hotel just plain comfortable and set you at ease. the only trouble we had was with the ipod docking system and ordering movies. the butler could not help us with either of these and had to call an engineer. neither were too familiar with the directv network on our tv. it was not set up for a hotel, but more for a home. so we never got a great list of movies to choose from that the rest of the hotel had access to. but overall we would go back.my fiancee and i needed to spend a night in atlanta for a cheerleading competition. we researched the hotels and decided on st regis hoping for a 5 star experience. unfortunately it didn't pan out. the room is pretty hi tech with the control panels on a phone in both the living area and the master bedroom. the one in the living area was easy to use. unfortunately the one in the master didn't work at all. the control panel regulated the heat, so we spent a night sweating since the heat couldn't be turned down. we also chose to buy a movie through their service. it played for about 5 minutes before freezing up. an engineer got involved. 45 minutes later we were able to start watching it again. he assured me he'd talk to the manager and have the movie comped for the inconvenience. of course it was still on my bill at check out. my fiancee and i both spoke, so i reserved a suite with a balcony per the on line reservations. guess what? no balcony. we weren't too concerned since it was obvious the room had already been smoked in before we got there. of course they charged me a smoking fee of $300, not once, but twice! maybe the hotel looks nice, but not this nice!i was somewhat disappointed with the level of service during my stay at the st. regis buckhead.i am usually a st.regis fan and stayed with them during past trips to nyc, and orange county. but this one in atl is just not up to the standards of other st.regis properties and other luxury brand hotels i have previously stayed with. the hotel itself is very elegant, nicely decorated and gives the southern charm they brave about but the level of service was a bit under my expectations.examples-bathrooms next to the ball room were trashed, no view from my room whatsoever, the dine in menu was boring, limited and overpriced. parking is expensive! it's atl not nyc!bottom line-beautiful, elegant, luxurious but didn't feel i was getting the value for my top $.this is hands down the absolute best hotel in atlanta. the rooms are incredible, staff is extremely attentive (concierge, butler service, etc.) and the pool, spa and gym are to die for! if youare visiting atlanta or just staying the night/weekend in the city, make this hotel your destination.the 4th of july weekend was our fourth time at this hotel. the prior time we had great experiences. this time we booked a published package that included an upscale\" 4th of july barbecue and free valet parking. at check in no one knew about this package. we were told that the barbecue was from noon until 4pm on the 4th. we then learned it was from 1 until 5pm. it was published to be in one location but then learned it was at poolside. at poolside we were told that we had to pay $35/pp b/c the barbecue was not in the package. after words with the staff they said they would bill it to the room and we could then work it out on checkout. the barbecue was far from \"upscale\" but standard fare in which drinks and desserts were extra. we complained about the rudeness of the staff and were told that \"they would tell the manager\" and \"they would credit back the charge\". thanks! it was in the package i paid for on check in. upon check out there was a bar charge for more than $60.00 which, if i had not carefully reviewed the bill to be sure the valet parking and barbecue were not listed, would have been placed on my amex card. i complained that it was not my charge and was asked if it could have been my wife's charge. finally, they checked and found that it was incorrectly posted to our account. the hotel again advised that \"they would take it off the account\". thanks - it was not mine to begin with. upon check in they upgraded us to a higher floor. the room carpet was stained. the marble entry foyer floor had black scuffs from shoes or luggage and the bedroom mirror full of streaks. the last night the night maid used a large quantity of some nasty smelling room deodorizer causing us to have to leave our doors open to air it out. these room issues are the things i would not have made mention of at a lesser quality hotel, but this hotel purports to be a luxury hotel. paces 88, the on site restaurant, had great food and service, as did room service.\"each of the many times we have been guests of the st. regis new york were wonderful experiences. i regard that hotel to be the standard for comparison for all city hotels worldwide, so i was greatly anticipating staying at the st. regis atlanta. we travel to atlanta often, as our daughter attends emory university there, and we normally stay at the ritz-carlton buckhead, on their club level. i reserved a grand deluxe room for my wife's birthday on your hotel website, and understood both from the website and the e-mail confirmation that the room had a plaza view\":room description1 kingplaza view, large balcony, non-smoking grand deluxe, butler service, classic oversized room, 440 sq. ft of enlightened elegance, soft color palette, classic design, luxurious bath and all the comforts of home.we arrived at the hotel at 2:30 pm, and were told that our room was not ready. since check-in was at 3:00 pm, we decided to remain in the hotel. i gave the front desk attendant my cell phone number to call when the room was available. at 3:45 pm, i checked again, as i had a planned meeting with a patient, and i required a room for privacy. we were again advised that the room was not yet available, and were offered another room to use temporarily. at approximately 5:00 pm, i checked again with the front desk about our room, and was told that our room had been available, although we were not contacted either by the temporary room phone or my mobile phone. we had our luggage sent to our room, as we were unable to go to the room ourselves because we were late for our dinner reservation.when we returned at 10:00 pm, we found our room was not as described. the room itself was lovely, but the view was of a parking deck. we were on the fifth floor, the deck was about 8-10 floors, and about 70 feet from our patio.the room was not properly serviced. aside from the lack of the st. regis signature turn-down service, there was a dirty drinking glass in the foyer, used dry cleaning wrapping in the closet, missing toiletries, urine in an unflushed toilet, and a dirty bathroom floor. since the butler had not arrived, i called to complain about the room and its condition. she apologized, but due to the late hour, we did not want to change rooms. you can imagine our mood as we retired on the evening of what was planned to be a special occasion.in the morning, i called the butler to ask for coffee (the website indicated that complimentary coffee and tea was a standard room amenity), and was advised that coffee was only complimentary with a requested wake-up call. after consulting with the hotel manager, the butler did not charge us for the coffee, and the manager came to our room to discuss our experience. he offered to move us to a suite, to provide us with a bottle of wine, or to somehow make up for the shortfall in some other way. my wife did not want to change rooms again, so he told us that he would add points to my starwood preferred gold account.the experience was quite a disappointment relative to our previous stays at the st. regis new york. i would certainly return to your new york property, but not likely to the st. regis atlanta.\"\n"
